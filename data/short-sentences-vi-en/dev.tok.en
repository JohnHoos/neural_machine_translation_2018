And I was very proud .
I was so shocked .
But many die .
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
These girls were so lucky .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
I started studying for the university entrance exam .
This was one of the lowest points in my life .
I lost all hope .
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Korean people . &quot;
Thank you .
Today I have just one request .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Remi is 22 , tall and very handsome .
Remi knows what love is .
He &apos;s not greedy . He doesn &apos;t see skin color .
Samuel is 16 . He &apos;s tall . He &apos;s very handsome .
He has the most impeccable memory .
He has a selective one , though .
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
He screamed a lot .
Extraordinary .
You can be extraordinary .
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Thank you .
Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt .
Also , asphalt can create a lot of noise .
Also the noise will disappear in these pores .
Sometimes you can create potholes with that .
Ha . He &apos;s ready .
So a microwave is a similar system .
So this is the specimen coming out now .
Several times we can repeat that .
But I will do a trial .
Let &apos;s see . Yeah , it worked .
Thank you .
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
It &apos;s everywhere .
Not exactly .
He told me two things .
And here &apos;s where those guns come in .
He needed them to feel protected .
And he was very , very sorry .
It happened twice more on the honeymoon .
So actually , I was in very good company .
Back to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
So I broke the silence .
The question , &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot;
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
We victims need everyone .
Thank you .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
First of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
I want to challenge that . Do you know why ?
Because MPs do not keep the environment clean .
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
They are hardly monogamous .
They are far from being extinct .
So there &apos;s two types of vultures in this planet .
They &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .
They clean up carcasses right to the bone .
So what is the problem with vultures ?
They are bird-blending machines .
We need to work with governments in regional levels .
We &apos;re working with local communities .
Thank you very much .
&quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; my father shouted .
&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
It was the only way we both could be educated .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Were we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
Today I am 22 .
My family believes in me .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
Like me , they are dreaming big .
Thank you .
Hi . This is my mobile phone .
Let &apos;s go back to that time , to this city .
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
Hold it up .
And I will talk about this .
These are 35,830 lines of information .
Raw data .
And why are these informations there ?
This directive &#91; is &#93; called Data Retention Directive .
Who sends whom a text message ?
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany .
Every time I use my mobile phone ?
So at the end , I had a settlement with them .
Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
I want to make them public .
You can see every step I take .
All this is possible with this information .
That &apos;s a little bit scary .
But it is not only about me .
It &apos;s about all of us .
You can see all of this .
Thank you .
Well you can see where this is going .
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
It &apos;s really become sacred to us .
I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
Thank you .
And there it was , a great revolution .
We did not prioritize right .
No , it didn &apos;t .
What is it , then ?
That &apos;s the real zipper .
May we all be granted a grace of mercy .
Thank you .
And I was scared .
First question to answer for us : so what ?
Tell us why your science is relevant to us .
And when you &apos;re describing your science , beware of jargon .
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down .
And when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Thank you .
Actually , for 10 years .
So luckily I brought an outfit change .
All right .
So why did I do that ?
That was awkward .
So the first question is , how do you become a model ?
You know ? You can be anything .
It will look something like this .
My friend got to come with me .
Here &apos;s me on the soccer team and in V Magazine .
And here &apos;s me today .
Thank you .
&quot; Before I die , I want to be tried for piracy . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to plant a tree . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live off the grid . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
Thinking about death clarifies your life .
Thank you .
Thank you .
No one knows what the hell we do .
No expensive staff time required .
And like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
We see all the same symptoms .
We see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
That means they can be self-administered .
They &apos;re high-speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup .
Thank you .
What are you going to get out of those samples ?
So you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
It &apos;s much better than that .
Ninety-nine . Well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Absolutely .
Thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .
Thanks , Tom .
I live in South Central .
This is South Los Angeles .
Liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
And I figured , this has to stop .
So I figured that the problem is the solution .
Food is the problem and food is the solution .
It &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
Thing is , it &apos;s owned by the city .
But you have to maintain it .
And the garden , it was beautiful .
And then somebody complained .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Come on , really ?
And I was like , &quot; Cool . Bring it . &quot;
Because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
We had a victory on our hands .
I mean , come on , why wouldn &apos;t they ?
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
That &apos;s 20 Central Parks .
That &apos;s enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
Why in the hell would they not okay this ?
Growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
See , I have a legacy in South Central .
See , I &apos;m an artist .
So what happened ?
To change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
We are the soil .
Plus you get strawberries .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
If they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
And when we do this , who knows ?
We might produce the next George Washington Carver .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong .
We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
Get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
And let that be your weapon of choice .
Peace . Thank you .
Thank you .
They kill our livestock .
So I grew up hating lions so much .
So they kill the lions .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
But lions are very clever .
So he jumps in and kills the animals .
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
So I set up everything .
And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
Thanks .
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And here I am today .
So you got this scholarship . Yep .
You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
Thank you so much . Thank you .
And I was distraught .
The book was published in 2009 .
Just go and read her book .
But they mean two different things .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
So what you do -- you shut up .
We don &apos;t work from offices .
We meet at the cafe . We meet at the pub .
We have zero infrastructure .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
Let me tell you a secret .
There is a problem with community meetings .
So planning has this blind spot .
You have to create a new profession .
I shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
Government ? Forget about it !
They were already drowning in manure .
Dearborn , Michigan . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to offer them confidentiality .
Guess what ?
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This person has never been born .
He wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
Nobody started a company alone . No one .
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
We activate communities .
Thank you .
We &apos;re pale , gray creatures .
As you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
We pulled debris from canals and ditches .
We got dirty , and we loved it .
And everyone was doing the same .
I was helping clean the onsen , the communal onsen , the huge giant bathtubs .
So we started retouching photos .
This was the very first .
It could take an hour . It could take weeks .
It could take months .
It was very time-consuming .
Now , we were lucky with our hand-cleaning .
We had an amazing local woman who guided us .
You don &apos;t get a chance to mess it up .
She also had duplicates .
One of them got caught up in the water .
We take photos constantly .
Thank you .
Some I even considered like my second home .
That equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
They have nothing to compare it to .
This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
It was more like a restaurant .
There were no back doors .
There were no windows large enough to climb through .
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
This is a family portrait .
My interpreter told me their stories .
&quot; We have no freedom , &quot; they said .
Wrong . They were all enslaved .
This young child is eight years old .
He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
Many of them drown .
in the cold , windy night .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
Mercury is used in the extraction process .
All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
I want to shine a light on slavery .
Thank you very much .
