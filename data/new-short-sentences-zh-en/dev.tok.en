A real school .
Were we being followed ?
There she is .
Today I am 22 .
Thank you .
And I was distraught .
Just go and read her book .
But they mean two different things .
The most important thing is passion .
Let me tell you a secret .
Government ? Forget about it !
Guess what ?
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This person has never been born .
Thank you .
And I was scared .
Thank you .
They didn &apos;t know .
And so the Senate won in the end .
A hundred and forty-seven .
Thank you very much .
But this is the geography of self .
Thank you .
Actually , for 10 years .
So luckily I brought an outfit change .
All right .
That was awkward .
It will look something like this .
Here &apos;s me on the same day as this shoot .
My friend got to come with me .
And here &apos;s me today .
Thank you .
Today I have just one request .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
He has the most impeccable memory .
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
He screamed a lot .
Extraordinary .
You can be extraordinary .
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Thank you .
So , Superman can fly .
Can we see it in full 3D ?
What &apos;s going on here ?
But lions are very clever .
So I had an idea .
So I set up everything .
Thanks .
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And here I am today .
I live in South Central .
This is South Los Angeles .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
Thing is , it &apos;s owned by the city .
And the garden , it was beautiful .
And then somebody complained .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Come on , really ?
And I was like , &quot; Cool . Bring it . &quot;
That &apos;s 20 Central Parks .
So what happened ?
We are the soil .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong .
Peace . Thank you .
Thank you .
It could take months .
It was very time-consuming .
She also had duplicates .
We take photos constantly .
Thank you .
It &apos;s everywhere .
Not exactly .
He told me two things .
The answer is easy .
So I broke the silence .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
Thank you .
And I was very proud .
I was so shocked .
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
These girls were so lucky .
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
I started studying for the university entrance exam .
I lost all hope .
Thank you .
Ha . He &apos;s ready .
So this is the specimen coming out now .
Several times we can repeat that .
And now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .
But I will do a trial .
Let &apos;s see . Yeah , it worked .
Thank you .
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
They are far from being extinct .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
They have nothing to compare it to .
It was more like a restaurant .
There were no back doors .
There were no windows large enough to climb through .
This is a family portrait .
Wrong . They were all enslaved .
This young child is eight years old .
He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
Many of them drown .
Mercury is used in the extraction process .
Thank you very much .
We see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
Thank you .
It &apos;s much better than that .
Absolutely .
Thanks , Tom .
Thank you .
