Here &apos;s a jelly .
I love that kind of stuff .
It &apos;s a colonial animal .
Here &apos;s the X-wing death jelly .
They &apos;re very little understood .
This is a volcanic ridge .
We &apos;re getting down further and further in scale .
These are called tube worms .
But they have two types of gill structures .
Oh ! Good going .
That &apos;s how they like to live .
And here &apos;s a male .
Here they go .
Those are all shrimp .
They don &apos;t need the sun at all .
This one &apos;s several stories tall .
Here &apos;s crabs here , worms here .
Here &apos;s pagoda structures .
There &apos;s a fish sitting here .
Learn to manage it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Why as a result , what happens ?
Last .
This isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-believe .
It &apos;s not .
I said &quot; play , &quot; all right .
We don &apos;t value play .
In fact , we devalue play .
Social : 45 years of what ?
To be serious .
To be really , really serious .
It did .
Be serious .
It &apos;s a serious gene .
But then what happens in step three ?
So what happens ?
What happens then ?
It &apos;s a crap system .
What a crime . What a crime .
We don &apos;t need mechanized workers .
I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
Just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot;
Well I &apos;m going to say no .
And you know what ?
Maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
Bears play .
It &apos;s the ones that play more .
The more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
And who are the biggest neotenists ?
Humans . We play sports .
We play musical instruments .
It is a huge benefit .
As a result , what happens ?
These guys are facts .
It &apos;s pretty bleak .
It &apos;s pretty glum .
Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
Is it fun ? Is it playful ?
It improves our ability to learn .
Our thinking is backwards .
We shouldn &apos;t be feeling guilty .
We should be celebrating play .
Quick example from the corporate world .
People , service , profit .
No way . We &apos;re different . &quot;
I asked them all .
Basically promoting fun .
First of all , you have to believe me .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
We &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
Fear is the enemy of play .
Let them be on the Internet .
Let them be on instant messengers .
Is that all there was ? &quot;
Unacceptable . Nepriemliv .
We don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
Today is the start of the uprising .
Thank you .
Now , some people have criticized us for this .
But that &apos;s not what you see .
Let &apos;s look at this in greater detail .
All that costs money .
How can Korea afford all of this ?
People were stunned by the results .
A lot of change .
And you can see other countries as well .
Everybody says that .
Those things really exist .
Every school succeeds .
This is where success is systemic .
And how do they do that ?
Thank you .
And this is the tower from below .
Thank you very much .
It was terribly dangerous .
The outcome , immediate .
&quot; To Sir , with Love &quot; ignited its teen audience .
Who was right , who wrong ?
Was the tale told well ?
Was there a hidden message ?
Thank you .
But what about that guy ?
I thought so .
Let me take you on a little tour .
Biohackers work alone .
We reverse engineer lab equipment .
We like to build things .
Then we like to take things apart .
We make things grow .
We make things glow .
And we make cells dance .
So this stuff is just beginning .
Looked like a ladybug , right ?
It actually is a Japanese beetle .
You can do a lot of things .
It &apos;s really cool .
It just has to follow safety guidelines .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
That was whistling .
I &apos;m trying to do this in English .
And I just couldn &apos;t .
And I would have lost my face .
I lost my face .
And she thought , &quot; He will never go there . &quot;
But actually I did .
That was great fun , of course .
You say , &quot; Huh , what do you mean ? &quot;
No , you can &apos;t .
Actually it &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
So I whistle the tone .
Sorry . I forgot one thing .
You whistle the same tone as me .
I heard a wide variety of tones .
This is very promising .
This is very promising .
Oh , hah .
I &apos;m so sorry , technicians .
I start it myself .
Okay , here it is .
Okay .
It &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
Not anymore .
Porous , nonporous .
So what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
You can see the difference .
It &apos;s that afraid of the water .
So what &apos;s going on here ? What &apos;s happening ?
So what are the applications ?
We &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
It could be anti-corrosion .
No water , no corrosion .
It could be anti-bacterial .
It &apos;s happening !
I was burned very badly .
And the nurses told me two things .
So that &apos;s what I did .
I kept on doing this for a while .
And here &apos;s how it went .
I would pass their sheet of paper .
How much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
What does this cause us ?
The same thing happens .
That &apos;s it . The task is finished . &quot;
Here is what happens .
Here is the thing .
It was about the norms for cheating .
They cheat just by a little bit .
Would they not be able to see it this way ?
Of course they would .
And I learned two interesting things .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s a somewhat more indirect way .
What &apos;s in it for me ?
Now , what &apos;s going on here ?
Well , let &apos;s think about it this way .
Now , that &apos;s one barrier .
That is the notion of investment .
You sacrifice now for a return later .
Thank you very much .
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera .
This is a sneak preview .
He &apos;s very shy , too .
DE : This is &quot; My Eagle Song . &quot;
So , are we ready Adam ?
Yeah .
TM : Bravo .
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
The sound system was kind of decent .
And it &apos;s been very exciting .
Okay , Africa .
It &apos;s no accident .
It actually improves it .
This is La Scala .
And the size of the room is not that big .
It &apos;s smaller than this .
This is Carnegie Hall .
It &apos;s larger than some of the other symphony halls .
They had to be very quiet .
This is a jazz band .
People are dancing , shouting and drinking .
And he &apos;s singing right into your ear .
He &apos;s whispering into your ears .
And they no longer have to be exactly the same .
One of the new ones is the automobile .
But now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
So that doesn &apos;t really work .
Yeah . I think it &apos;s evolutionary .
It &apos;s adaptive .
And they &apos;ll vote for that .
We adapt .
We sing .
Thank you very much .
That &apos;s a natural human emotion .
It &apos;s a massive problem .
That &apos;s their problem . &quot;
I came this close to doing it .
That &apos;s the stigma .
And I believe that we can .
This is a dream come true . Thank you .
Thank you .
And everybody &apos;s crying now .
It was a huge amount of pictures .
Crazy , crazy .
They said , &quot; Syria ? &quot; &quot; Syria . &quot;
&quot; Lebanon ? &quot; &quot; Lebanon . &quot;
It &apos;s everybody . &quot; The Chinese .
This is the enemy .
What ?
And it &apos;s going both ways .
And you become friends .
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago .
Just read where those guys are from .
Just people sending their pictures .
Crazy , yes ?
Oh my God .
Don &apos;t cry .
Thank you guys .
Let &apos;s talk trash .
but , mostly bottle caps .
I got plenty of takers .
And this .
We have to throw it away .
Charles Moore : Thank you .
How do you feed a city ?
We &apos;re very hungry for fossil fuels too .
None of it makes very much sense .
And it was also fertile .
And this changes everything .
Now it &apos;s anonymous .
So instead of trusting it , we fear it .
It &apos;s not a new question .
Well I think it looks a bit like this .
By the way , these can be men as well .
Cows with a view .
Steaming piles of humus .
This is basically bringing the whole thing together .
Thank you very much .
Eddi Reader : &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill &quot;
But this is &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill . &quot;
Thank you very much .
So that became a challenge .
They didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
Please keep your seat .
A very different feeling .
It was cadaverically cold to the touch .
The nervous system has plasticity .
Well , what do we do about that ?
But the future is actually even brighter .
Thank you very much .
We are talking about the high seas .
This is indeed the true heart of the planet .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
And how did we do that ?
It &apos;s actually a bay .
Thank you .
Actually , it &apos;s a really big idea .
This is a great technology .
But it wasn &apos;t always that way .
And it was because of scenes like this .
This disease was terrifying .
This is the picture .
Hundreds of people were paralyzed .
But the message was very clear .
It can &apos;t live for a very long time in people .
It &apos;s just two drops , like that .
There &apos;s absolutely no question .
These are children like Umar .
Umar also has polio .
Umar was paralyzed for life .
India &apos;s not unique .
Thank you .
It keeps getting reinfected .
Now what about the money ?
And is it easy to raise that money ?
And what &apos;s it going to be like the next couple of years ?
But right now we don &apos;t have enough of that .
I never did have someone . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve found love . I &apos;m happy . &quot;
Right . You know what I &apos;m saying .
This one &apos;s my favorite .
Thank you for making your site .
He turns four tomorrow . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
Have a real happy birthday , and I love you .
I &apos;ll say bye for now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hold your head up . Look at me .
Explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
Why are you crying ? &quot;
Just go on , go on in your room .
And he &apos;s five years old .
And I think back .
I think back to my father .
And the limousine empties out .
And this guy , he was up to a lot of no good .
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good .
His mother had died from a heroin overdose .
He was being raised by his grandmother .
His father wasn &apos;t on the set .
His grandmother had two jobs .
He was home alone a lot .
He was cool . He was fine .
That &apos;s what the sisters said , &quot; He was fine . &quot;
He was having sex .
We all looked up to him .
&quot; Hey Anthony , come on upstairs . &quot;
Johnny call , you go .
So I run right upstairs .
There ain &apos;t no first time .
He told me to go in his room .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She &apos;s nude .
So when I go in the room , I close the door .
Folks , I &apos;m petrified .
So now there &apos;s a living room full of guys .
He said to me , &quot; I would be free . &quot;
Thank you folks .
Then you take off .
You sit there , OK .
I &apos;m probably going to jump .
So nice air comes flowing in .
Boom .
You are going to hit the ground .
You can &apos;t delay that much .
And that &apos;s not going to hurt .
This was my father in Vietnam .
The enemy didn &apos;t break a sweat doing it .
Sort of leadership by humiliation .
We failed .
The mission didn &apos;t work .
Entirely new requirement .
Also , the people had changed .
Then another thing .
And he said , &quot; Sir , he &apos;s fine . Thanks for asking . &quot;
I said , &quot; Where is he now ? &quot;
It &apos;s a promise .
That was my journey .
I hope it &apos;s not over .
This isn &apos;t easy stuff .
And it isn &apos;t always fair .
Thank you .
I saw . &quot; What is that ? &quot; I asked .
It &apos;s not like I can just check it in the lab .
Even in Bangalore you won &apos;t get &#91; one &#93; , in India .
Close your eyes . &quot;
Why I am not getting &#91; any &#93; ?
My God , it &apos;s unbelievable .
That is my invention .
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
Play video one .
That is my idea .
I &apos;m sustaining on seventh year .
I &apos;m doing something serious .
Not in front pocket . I &apos;m a back pocket man .
Thank you very much . Bye !
Stephen Hawking : Questioning the universe
How did the universe come into being ?
Are we alone in the universe ?
Is there alien life out there ?
What is the future of the human race ?
Thank you for listening .
Thank you very much indeed .
So I went to a party .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand . Soybeans ?
I said , &quot; You jerk . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Let &apos;s get married . &quot;
So we did .
The surgeon emerged from the surgery .
And yet , he did not die .
Mysteriously , he lived on .
He coached Little League for our son .
I &apos;m looking for a cure .
Then another year goes by .
Two years go by .
We take the kids to Australia .
They &apos;re exotic . They &apos;re experimental .
There &apos;s another drug out there .
It &apos;s newer . It &apos;s more powerful .
He started it just two weeks ago .
Perhaps there &apos;s still hope ahead .
So what do I say ?
And Terence died six days later .
It was also an expensive fight .
We always had hope .
And what did I discover ?
Yet I had that piece of paper .
We both did .
And they were readily available .
I had them right at hand .
They say it &apos;s denial .
The family won &apos;t listen to reason .
They &apos;re in denial .
It &apos;s not just families either .
You want to help . You want to fix .
You want to do .
I saw it firsthand .
Days before he died .
It &apos;s not a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
So what do we need ?
Actually , one of Cleopatra &apos;s guys .
And he &apos;s been a pretty good general .
The people are leaving . They &apos;re playing instruments .
They &apos;re singing .
Hope isn &apos;t a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Thank you .
And why not ?
And what is happiness ?
Happiness is the freedom of choice .
Where does choice come from ?
Did Africa feed itself ?
And I thought that was incredibly peculiar .
But that is actually changing .
It seems very ambitious .
So the potential is there .
The will is there .
The commitment is there .
Thank you very much .
And the latter won out .
... with one broken leg .
Thursday night is elicit drug use .
Silence on the phone .
Thank you very much .
Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing .
No , they are full of misery .
And he came one day back to campus .
He stayed late at night every day .
There was another condition .
What happened ?
And everybody raised their hand .
And everybody raised their hand .
That was the task .
And people did the first sheet .
And we had three conditions .
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
I put things in the wrong way .
I can &apos;t say enjoy those pieces .
People did not want them .
Maybe the taste was not good .
No , the taste was great .
So what did they do ?
How much do you want to pay for it ? &quot;
And we had two types of people .
We tried to make it more difficult .
Now think about kids .
And you played with them for a few hours .
Most people say not that much .
Those are really tough .
Let me say one last comment .
I think the answer is no .
Thank you very much .
They want to get back to slower rhythms .
The workplace .
I think there are various reasons .
Thank you very much .
The DRC is a dangerous place .
There are many health issues as well .
He said there &apos;s just not in demand .
They like the generics .
Sex !
Thank you .
Infrastructure is going to be affected .
But now , a word of caution .
The larger point I &apos;m trying to make is this .
There are no quick fixes .
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
But the operative word is doing .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t have much time to do it .
This is something that has editing and it has teams .
So that was the core idea .
Let &apos;s see if I can find it . For anyone who is -- gets motion sickness , I apologize .
So this is the building .
This is going into one of the entries .
That was the main sort of technology area in the building .
Now up .
She said yes .
You dizzy yet ?
OK , so here , this is the book spiral .
I &apos;m going to go very , very quickly through this .
We invest the money in the operation of the building .
This is the theater up close .
The proscenium line can also disappear .
This is it at night -- sorry , from a distance .
And at night .
This is a monster truck show .
This also is an unusual client .
So our strategy was very simple .
So , how to build this .
It &apos;s very simple : it &apos;s a chair .
This is not a high-budget building .
Now , I want to ask a question .
That was easy . OK .
What part of this do people not understand ?
And that &apos;s true .
So then , what do we do about that ?
But it isn &apos;t .
That &apos;s the wrong answer .
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
You won &apos;t be able to withstand them .
And this is what it is .
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
And there are only seven of them .
What can damage accumulate in ?
And you know what happened .
So , you know , this does happen .
This is what &apos;s going to take a bit of money .
Not very long . OK .
Thank you .
AG : That &apos;s right .
The water is completely black .
So it &apos;s right up in the heavens .
That &apos;s not the worst part of it .
I could barely breathe .
I was gasping for air .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
Take some time to rest and think about things .
The warning signs are all there .
So thank you very , very much .
Ah yes , a table .
Okay , what is this object ?
I don &apos;t get it .
Does anyone know ? Chi ?
I like to read books on it .
I just explained design .
Thank you very much .
Lakshmi Pratury : The lost art of letter-writing
But too late .
Thank you .
And then this happened .
And the answer , by all accounts , was no .
There &apos;s a very short list of these places .
And that doesn &apos;t seem right .
Thank you .
Thanks .
It is helpless .
It has to totally surrender .
To be compassionate is not a joke .
It &apos;s not that simple .
When somebody &apos;s in pain , we pick up the pain .
Each one has got two games .
One person wins .
Why ? Empathy .
That &apos;s human heart .
Compassion is not defined in one form .
There &apos;s no Indian compassion .
There &apos;s no American compassion .
Love is something you discover .
I will come to it later .
It has got to be you .
Maybe the swami is right .
Compassion is going to be limited .
Everything is going to be limitless .
It is love first .
You need to .
You have to act it out .
That &apos;s interesting to me .
That is where you fake .
You fake it and make it .
Ask for compassion .
Do it .
With these words , thank you very much .
The approach worked .
EW : The full monty .
We need — thank you .
Innovation drives economic growth .
We miss him .
Okay , Glass , record a video .
Go !
Man 6 : Holy &#91; beep &#93; ! That is awesome .
Woman 3 : Okay , Glass , record a video !
Woman 4 : Google &quot; jellyfish . &quot;
Man 10 : It &apos;s beautiful .
You &apos;re just kind of moving around .
Thank you all very much .
Hello voicemail , my old friend .
Say your motorcycle crashes .
Every week it &apos;ll arrive at your door .
I &apos;ll show you what I mean .
Which they do .
And I have a copy .
With your voices on it !
The off switch is in there somewhere .
I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s there !
I &apos;m sorry ; it &apos;s not one yet .
So why is United States in the &quot; U &quot; s ?
He said , &quot; I &apos;m a tap counter . &quot;
You do not .
Audience : Go on .
The Bill Gates song !
I &apos;m gettin &apos; royalties from everyone .
You buy the box ; I &apos;ll sell the code .
Big mediocrity in every way .
You won &apos;t believe me .
You try rhyming with garage !
Don &apos;t cry for me , Cupertino .
The truth is , I never left you .
I made a fortune over at Pixar .
People did not think it was worth putting a price on it .
They had voice recorders and FM transmitters .
The lesson was : simplicity sells .
Oh yeah .
It could be the design of the thing you &apos;re using .
Bravo .
DP : Thank you very much .
Hear , hear !
Of course , he &apos;d get really bored .
That didn &apos;t go over really well .
So how do we do that ?
Thank you very much .
Brené Brown : Listening to shame
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
It was not really you .
It was a little different than what you usually do .
But it was great . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Let me ask you something . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she goes , &quot; Uh ... no . &quot;
That ... me neither . &quot;
The majority of people .
Vulnerability is not weakness .
What would you like for me to talk about ?
There &apos;s three big answers .
And I &apos;m going to be really honest with you .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
I &apos;m a fifth generation Texan .
I turn around , I go , &quot; Hi . &quot;
&quot; Look away . &quot;
And I see you .
And we &apos;re going to walk in .
Here &apos;s why .
Yes ? We heard that .
Yes ?
So you know what I did ? I made it . &quot;
I can &apos;t wait to tell people this .
I guess I &apos;m doing it right now .
No , it is .
You know why this place is amazing ?
You &apos;re not good enough .
Shame is that thing .
Us .
Shame is &quot; I am bad . &quot;
And here &apos;s what you need to know .
And here &apos;s what you even need to know more .
Guilt , inversely correlated with those things .
And it &apos;s a straight-jacket .
Weak .
And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t study men . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And that is seductive .
We want you to go in .
I took a couple victory laps in there .
We deal in milliseconds .
Thank you .
So , I decided to investigate .
Why were other people blocking it ?
You could neglect me .
You could abuse it .
And it &apos;s simple .
And why should we care about this ?
We talk about world peace .
Thank you .
This is Nepal .
This is Nepal and Tibet .
Thank you .
Desire needs space .
But then I took a question with me .
Nobody needs anybody .
For good reasons , right ?
But basically it &apos;s when there is novelty .
So where do you go in sex ?
It isn &apos;t just a behavior .
You know , animals have sex .
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
&quot; I shut myself off when ... &quot; began to be the question .
And then I began to ask the reverse question .
&quot; Are you going to be there ?
Are you going to be angry with me ? &quot;
They don &apos;t really do well together .
It &apos;s willful . It &apos;s intentional .
Merry Valentine &apos;s .
Trees epitomize stasis .
You might have a guess .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
That , I think , is movement .
Thank you very much .
Robbie Mizzone : Thank you .
Tommy Mizzone : Thank you very much .
TM : Thank you very much .
He &apos;s also our brother .
TM : Thank you very much .
RM : Thank you .
Would they delight us ?
And we can play with this .
Surfaces can become porous .
They can stretch . They can tear .
How ? And at what scale ?
I chose to design a column .
Columns are architectural archetypes .
We can begin to zoom into them .
But enough of the theory .
So where does this leave us ?
Thank you .
The rocket was huge .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
Thank you , Chris .
OK , this is Mount Everest .
It &apos;s 29,035 feet high .
OK , this is the route up Everest .
This is a view of base camp .
This was our expedition .
This is me crossing a crevasse .
That &apos;s another crevasse .
Okay . This is Camp One .
This is a view taken from camp three .
There &apos;s no ice over it .
And this is at Camp Four .
It &apos;s the first part of climb .
So that &apos;s what happened .
The summit would be in the foreground .
You can barely stand outside the tent .
He really said that .
I have a family to come back to . &quot;
OK , but he &apos;s losing ground here .
He &apos;s running out of energy .
He &apos;s dying .
He &apos;s beginning to think about his family .
These are Tibetan prayer flags .
Thank you .
No , I &apos;m just joking .
I &apos;ll show you some statistics .
That &apos;s a four-fold increase .
Frogs .
It &apos;s a plasticizer .
Scientists agree now .
How do you show that ?
What is it ?
Oh what ?
Perflourooctanoic acid .
Blimey .
Never heard of it .
Help me .
Thank you .
There are things that you stand for .
You &apos;re here to change lives .
What are we doing about changing lives ?
Small actions , big difference .
So just think about it .
And I can go on and on .
Thank you very much .
I wasn &apos;t the only one .
It needs months and years .
It &apos;s the whole book .
What happens when time warps ?
Far away over there is now here .
And that &apos;s not all .
Like it . Find other books exactly like his .
It cannot be stored .
Attention is time .
It threatens the flow of love .
We can choose otherwise .
Thank you .
Yeah .
I did my best .
It &apos;s different from being shy .
But now here &apos;s where the bias comes in .
So no wilderness , no revelations .
So ...
That &apos;s our cultural inheritance .
Guess what ?
Books .
Just stop it .
Thank you .
That is great .
School , same thing .
And that &apos;s okay .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
And then there was another influence .
I mean , look at those graphics there .
&quot; You know , do people really use it ?
And I didn &apos;t want to be a colorist .
It wasn &apos;t what I wanted to do .
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff .
So , it goes from a circle , to a round , to a square , to a figure eight .
So , the light bulb actually does that .
And this is what we &apos;re pursuing here .
And then , of course , design is never done .
Thank you .
This picture is incredible .
I mean , to me , it just means so much .
And we went away from obviously the beige .
I mean it &apos;s colorful , it &apos;s fun .
Like paper , paper and cardboard .
And here &apos;s the public service announcement for this project .
Get some .
Yeah ? All right , all right . I have only a few .
So , thank you .
You &apos;ve gotta sell something .
She &apos;s going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form .
We sell all the student books .
There &apos;s the ocean maps you can see on the left .
People would come in and say , &quot; What the -- ?
They would say , &quot; What is this ? &quot;
This is Sam Potts &apos; great design that did this .
These are all handmade .
These are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
So you can see the full effect !
You can read this quote .
There &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
Anyway . So I &apos;m going to jump ahead .
We created a website .
Thank you so much .
This is a beefalo .
This is a cama .
Then there &apos;s the liger .
It &apos;s bigger than a tiger .
These are normal cells .
They did it with pigs .
They did it with puppies .
Other states have banned them .
It &apos;s not just insects .
This is a brain from a lamprey eel .
It &apos;s photophilic .
Thanks .
Now we &apos;ll explain that in a second .
Let &apos;s play a little .
I can also make him spin .
We call this the orbiting mode .
All right , thank you , Thomas .
Thank you .
Thank you .
But first , my disclosures .
I am not a breast cancer survivor .
I &apos;m not a radiologist .
But that very fact is telling .
What about ultrasound ?
It &apos;s just way too much equipment .
So how does this work ?
So here &apos;s an example .
MBI found 83 percent .
Thank you .
It comes as a part of our everyday learning .
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs .
What we are interested in is information .
We want to know about things .
Thank you .
You can of course watch movies .
and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54 . &quot; ) And you can of course play games .
Paper world is interesting to play with .
That &apos;s all . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is incredible , really .
Open source ? Wow .
PM : Yeah . Yes , yes , of course .
What are your plans ? MIT ?
Thank you so much .
That &apos;s fantastic .
Nice show . Man , that was good !
DH : Thank you .
You actually just did that .
BF : Shut up .
DH : And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece .
BF : Oh yeah , it does .
BF : Oh , Daniel .
DH : One more ?
Perfect .
Perfect .
BF : OK . DH : Oh ! All right .
BF : Also three with his left .
DH : Perfect .
BF : First try ? Once on purpose ?
DH : He &apos;s looking at me .
BF : That &apos;s all right , he does that . All right .
Oh , good . All right .
And then we thought , &quot; How stupid . &quot;
DH : Next session ?
BF : OK , sorry .
BF : Sure .
DH : All right , please stand here in front ...
It &apos;s kind of neat . OK .
DH : Wow , you &apos;ve been working out .
BF : No , shut up !
OK , here we go .
There you go .
OK .
OK , hold on .
RW : Hmmm .
DH : First one .
What happened there ?
DH : I don &apos;t get it .
DH : Sorry . BF : Having some bad flashbacks .
RW : Do you want me to hold you or not ? DH : Don &apos;t hold me that hard .
RW : Do I get to hold them ?
Could you just push that ?
DH : Wow ! Boy !
DH : True . Barry ...
BF : I &apos;m going to run up behind him .
Still juggling .
Impossible , you say ?
BF : Incredible , you say ?
BF : Here we go .
DH : I think so , that &apos;s right .
Even the pencil .
BF : He invented the pencil .
Or a virgin for a sacrifice ?
BF : Anything ?
BF : Yeah , it &apos;s all right .
BF : Yeah , a little sketchy .
BF : Yeah .
DH : Then here we go .
We went too far .
May we have it a bit louder ?
DH : Whoa , sorry . All right .
BF : We &apos;re going on .
BF : All right ? Oh my gosh . Oh .
DH : All right , here we go . Sorry about that .
BF : There we go !
Somebody dance ! Come on !
Wow , wow , OK , stop .
DH : The French judge ...
BF : One more quick thing .
BF : Well , you know ...
DH : That &apos;s right .
BF : Good .
BF : Juggling &apos;s got a bad rap .
What do you want me to do with it ?
BF : Yeah , it &apos;s a good setup . That &apos;s a big setup .
BF : Nice .
BF : Nice .
BF : It &apos;s progress , that &apos;s the thing .
And it &apos;s awfully windy over there .
Oh , look how it lies there .
Too much Olympics .
What gem of knowledge ?
What pearl of wisdom ?
Do you want to buy a vowel , Barry ?
Is that your final answer ?
DH : I do , I do .
DH : We will juggle seven .
BF : Yes .
BF : Oh , oh , whoa .
BF : Seven-club juggling .
DH : ... to back .
BF : Thank you , that &apos;s it .
BF : Thank you guys !
DH : Thank you very much !
It &apos;s not hardware .
It &apos;s not software .
It &apos;s bioware .
Thank you very much .
That &apos;s quite a lot .
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars .
What do they do ?
Small animals eat insects .
Even larger animals eat insects .
There &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
And you can eat something new everyday .
What are you eating ?
And we eat quite a lot of it .
It &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
But it &apos;s increasing enormously .
Pigs are quite like us .
So that &apos;s one point for insects .
And there &apos;s the conversion factor .
We &apos;re not taking the bonus yet .
We &apos;re not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
And there &apos;s the environment .
So less waste .
We &apos;ll have to .
It &apos;s just very good food .
It has many benefits .
Who wouldn &apos;t like to eat a shrimp ?
They are delicacies .
Well that &apos;s just a matter of mindset .
Well they are .
It &apos;s not something that is a hobby of mine .
So why not eat insects ?
You should try it yourself .
And it looks delicious .
MD : Thank you .
All right . Okay , so ... perfect .
Perfect .
Okay .
That &apos;s it . Please save this .
Great , here we go .
They hold potluck dinners .
They serve food to poor people .
And not only food , right .
So here he is beginning .
Which , of course , spread virally .
Hugely successful .
Here &apos;s lesson number one .
LL : Or ...
LL : Right . Bingo . Point .
Wildly different .
This guy is no Republican .
Read the license .
The creator doesn &apos;t have any rights .
Now , I think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about openness .
So I didn &apos;t think much about it .
This is absurd .
It is outrageous .
John McCain .
Thank you very much .
1.1 million of them .
There is no way back home .
Thank you .
Let me tell you a story .
There &apos;s silence .
I &apos;m totally clueless .
Don &apos;t get too attached to him .
Here &apos;s what had to happen .
Some are much more crafty .
And now all of you understand it .
Well , there were a couple of reasons .
This is horrifying .
What is the point ? &quot;
And you &apos;re like , &quot; Actually , shut up !
I &apos;m just trying to tell a story . &quot;
That &apos;s not true at all .
But I think that &apos;s unlikely .
How should you start ?
Thank you .
What &apos;s happening to the climate ?
It is unbelievably bad .
And it was something called EcoRock .
Thank you . Thank you .
We must change everything .
Thank you so much .
So it &apos;s very useful .
So that was the goal of my design .
That was the problem .
They have money and power .
Those are invisible .
That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
Over two million people became refugees .
But over two million people cut trees .
So I remember it was so disappointing .
And I was very lucky .
People suffer mentally and physically .
I was very happy to hear that .
So this is under construction .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
All right .
All right .
You don &apos;t need to remember that .
You don &apos;t just jump into an invitation .
Let &apos;s go somewhere else . &quot;
It took five years .
How ?
Thank you .
Maybe it &apos;s been towed .
Thank you very much .
Blue curtain .
Come on , Josh !
Go !
Are we there yet ?
I don &apos;t think so .
Hey , yeah !
What time is it ?
Where are we ?
Josh .
Somi .
Bill T.
Josh .
Somi .
Bill T.
Yeah , yeah !
We should stop looking outside .
I &apos;m talking about all companies .
Have sex .
Walk the dog .
Have breakfast with my wife and children .
Have sex again .
Do three hours &apos; work .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
Meditate for half an hour .
Have sex .
Walk the dog . Have sex again .
Go to bed .
We need to be realistic .
A day is too short ; &quot; after I retire &quot; is too long .
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
And I understand .
&quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
Values are a certain kind of fact .
Probably not .
And these await our discovery .
We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
The concept of physical health is undefined .
Why would we think this ?
But it clearly admits some exceptions .
Now , what stands in the way of this ?
He &apos;s a string theorist .
I &apos;m not a fan . &quot;
But this is just the point .
So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
Thank you very much .
So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
Salaam . Namaskar .
Good morning .
Not me .
A flock of relatives descended on her .
They broke her bangles .
This is tradition . &quot;
Had I heard right ?
She is also immensely pragmatic .
&quot; He was flattered .
I also like rock and roll .
The peace talks dragged on and on and on .
Then things get tense .
They have to negotiate .
Thank you .
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
I think this is a problem .
Dreadful . Thumbs down .
Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
That &apos;s when he falls .
I call this error blindness .
Think back for a moment to elementary school .
This is not mine , by the way .
Okay , so fine .
Everything seems to have gone fine .
So this is a huge practical problem .
So this is a catastrophe .
It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
And something else happened instead .
I mean , this is life .
So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We tell another story .
We hold another conference .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you guys .
I went to Northern Liberia .
She was the laughing stock of the community .
With tears in my eyes , I said , &quot; No . &quot;
When I asked , &quot; Who is that ? &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s Wei .
The meaning of her name is pig .
I wish to go with you .
I wish to go to school . &quot;
I wish to go to school . &quot;
She &apos;s highly athletic .
Full scholarship . She gets it .
She goes to school on the first day .
It &apos;s disheartening , it &apos;s sad .
Juanita is her name .
I wish for a better life .
I will fulfill the wish .
I failed to do this .
So I will do this .
She went to school .
Thank you .
And this was at the beginning of elections .
He &apos;s out of office today .
Here are a few .
How long should I stay in this factory ?
How much money can I save ?
Thank you .
Leslie Chang : One minute ?
One minute .
Thanks so much for your talk .
Thank you very much .
Then another Iran-Iraq war .
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder .
It was a huge event .
This is the other side of that same picture .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s no great surprise .
And I &apos;ll give you an example of that .
Right .
Yeah . All right .
So that &apos;s what we did .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut .
And so this goes on for some time .
Thanks very much .
David Logan : Tribal leadership
So here is the bottom line .
And so people form tribes .
But here &apos;s the rub .
Now , this is the lowest of the stages .
You don &apos;t want this . Okay ?
Actually , no , I &apos;m not .
And we park . And we stay .
I &apos;m great and you &apos;re not .
This is their lobby .
Notice people are applauding for us .
Sorry .
Two percent are at Stage One .
And those are the ones that change the world .
I don &apos;t know anybody .
In fact , that &apos;s progress .
So , they were bored .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
And flowers are a real bugger .
Why would they go to that bother ?
And sure enough , there &apos;s the insect .
Now this is a plant .
And this is the mimic .
It &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
And this one doesn &apos;t have anything for them .
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier .
So flies love this .
It &apos;s really horrible .
And blowflies just can &apos;t help themselves .
This is the philodendron selloum .
This is the most amazing thing .
And they get inside , and they get it all on .
So there &apos;s something that goes on off the end there .
Well yes we can .
And that &apos;s the sort of thing that it would be seeing .
Thank you very much .
We are all born artists .
They &apos;re shocked .
But you shouldn &apos;t worry .
Parents should celebrate .
All right ! It calls for celebration .
Soon , a story develops .
And you continue to make connections .
Kids do art .
I was in Jeju Island a few days ago .
There &apos;s no need .
But kids don &apos;t mind .
We can play all night long .
You know this gentleman , right ?
&quot; I &apos;m drawing diligently , &quot; I said .
&quot; Why are you using only black ? &quot;
Or so I wished .
&quot; You &apos;ll get it ! &quot; he said .
Look what I found .
No crows are brought up .
Most of the works have no title , Untitled .
This is Picasso &apos;s .
That was Duchamp .
They get locked in .
That &apos;s our tragedy .
Or some people dance in clubs .
That &apos;s what I think .
What should we do then ?
Yes , that &apos;s right .
It will say a lot of things .
They are devils . Devils .
And they have a magic question .
Art is the ultimate goal .
King Lear .
That &apos;s the world I dream of .
Wow . I was touched .
Thank you .
Enjoy it while it lasts .
And there are different ways .
We were actually recording history .
It was still 1991 .
And basically what I was saying is very simple .
It &apos;s business anywhere .
See that it will not work .
I knew two things after that meeting .
We start the meeting .
And here is the most stunning number .
That is a &quot; Who is Who &quot; list .
And I want to offer you a deal .
How much would that cost ?
The governor says , &quot; We will close you . &quot;
Six months later the newspaper was closed .
That is not too much , is it ?
It &apos;s actually just a drop in the sea .
And it &apos;s called fundraising .
And those can be environmental bonds .
You can bring it to Asia .
What do investors get ?
Thank you .
This , also , is nothing new .
&quot; I feel a bit better now . &quot;
Other views are also available .
&quot; I feel very lonely . &quot;
&quot; I feel invisible to you . &quot;
&quot; I love how I feel today . &quot;
There are two modes to the time capsule .
What are the great stories of today ?
So , Universe will open here .
Any of those can be opened up .
Here we have our secrets .
Evolution is speeding up .
Thank you .
Well , first one , analytic skills .
And , I mean , there is a set of conditions .
I am coming from a country called Serbia .
You will know the outcome .
It &apos;s selection of strategies and tactics .
Well , that &apos;s just the beginning of the show .
Don &apos;t mix tools with the substance .
This is the difference between two towns .
Thank you .
This is Tiananmen Square .
It said &quot; David , age 10 . &quot;
David : ambition to be a doctor .
Favorite sport : football . What did he enjoy most ?
How did he die ?
Tortured to death .
And we never did .
Thank you .
I went in to see her .
But now , for the last few days , she &apos;d been seeing things .
So I said , &quot; What sort of things ? &quot;
Animals too .
They come to a certain point and then stop .
Then it changes again .
I said , &quot; Is this like a dream ? &quot;
And she has a sense of humor .
She knew it was a hallucination .
She had no control over them .
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
But she was blind .
She said , &quot; Who is this Charles Bonnet ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Did he have them himself ? &quot;
I work in old-age homes , largely .
His grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
His vision was pretty poor .
And he knew it was a hallucination .
They don &apos;t usually fade in and out .
They are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
And you start to see things .
She had very mobile hallucinations as well .
A lot of them had to do with a car .
Why Kermit ?
And these frightened her .
They seduce you . They humiliate you .
They jeer at you .
You interact with them .
You &apos;re at a particular road junction .
You smell chestnuts roasting .
And you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different .
I had to bring it in .
Suddenly this , and suddenly that .
Think of the number of blind people .
Thanks very much .
Well , yeah , a lot of them .
And I see the geometrical hallucinations .
Thank you so much for sharing .
OS : Thank you . Thank you .
As a child , I had two passions .
Africa was truly fascinating for me .
We chose rats .
Why would you choose rats ?
Because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
There , the animal finds a mine .
It scratches on the soil .
Very , very simple .
Very sustainable in this environment .
And that &apos;s how it works .
Very , very simple .
Now why would you use rats ?
Now how do we communicate with rats ?
Question of scale .
So how does it work ?
This is a positive sample .
But let &apos;s stick first to tuberculosis .
This is in a prototype stage .
We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
Thank you very much .
Amy Tan : Where does creativity hide ?
OK .
There was a reason for everything .
You won &apos;t discover anything .
And then we have intentions .
What are we supposed to do ?
And what I need , in effect , is a focus .
And it seems like it &apos;s happening all the time .
And you are noticing it more often .
But you apply this .
And I needed to find something historically that would match that .
And I asked him , &quot; How is it possible to do this ? &quot;
A big thing that I also think about is accidents .
What is the nature of accidents ?
Responsibility was assigned to the family .
It &apos;s the son , not the father . &quot;
So , there are never complete answers .
There she is .
Thank you very much !
Some of them were new stories .
There are thousands upon thousands of them .
They respond to it .
I double checked the newspapers .
Thank you .
Yes , breast cancer .
But it wasn &apos;t easy .
Believe me , it definitely wasn &apos;t easy .
Difficult .
Durga , the fearless one .
It &apos;s the power of focus .
It &apos;s the power of an image .
You see some incredible stuff .
How do we study that ?
What do I mean by that ?
You &apos;re looking at a great example here .
Which one of these guys am I actually related to ?
And he did a pretty good job .
But based on what data ?
Who were these people who came before ?
Now multiply it by 100 .
What &apos;s the take-home message ?
Such an amazing story .
Look at some stone tools .
The stone tools become much more finely crafted .
The population size started to expand .
And it &apos;s basically a meat locker .
In this case , you actually can .
Thank you very much .
And she was hot .
Because it &apos;s obviously incredibly frightening .
There was no starting point for peace .
There was no day of global unity .
So obviously we didn &apos;t have any money .
I was living at my mom &apos;s place .
He was a prisoner of war .
So he was like my hero .
And I remember the first letter .
It wasn &apos;t about the end result .
And thank you to all of them .
It &apos;s just symbolism .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d heard .
I won &apos;t go into that .
We will observe this day .
And we gave the film over .
Obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
They were saying they would stop .
Ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
We have to work together .
He &apos;s an amazing man .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s absolutely possible . &quot;
I said , &quot; What would you do ?
It &apos;s all about the individuals .
It &apos;s all about you and me .
It &apos;s all about partnerships .
Thank you TED . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks a lot .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Coke is everywhere .
So why does this matter ?
&quot; Wash you hands , you might not get diarrhea . &quot;
I &apos;m not kidding .
No loo , no &quot; I do . &quot;
Can you you believe that ?
Let &apos;s look at a country like India .
So many more people would have been affected .
And we are so close .
And this victory is so possible .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Adam Savage : My obsession with objects and the stories they tell
First of all , there &apos;s the object in the world .
This is where it gets weird .
like it is in the movie .
Yeah , I know !
But there &apos;s a problem .
Thank you .
I &apos;m a process engineer .
This is an inherited disorder .
I was already up at 4.4 .
So where do we start ?
Well this is a sagittal slice through me .
Happy , away I went .
So it really is great .
This is a list of the core team .
Jargon is a big one .
In the medical world they look up at plans .
They don &apos;t want to change .
I &apos;m at seven and a half years .
Dead easy to give him respect .
That &apos;s all the bad news .
When you &apos;re looking around , what do you consider ?
OK , that &apos;s fair enough .
But really , the question is , why ? Right ?
And you can do them with phone kiosks .
I think , quite a nice feature .
And it &apos;s , quite simply , the point of reflection .
Let me give you another example of delegation .
And it works like this .
I &apos;m sending money back , and it works like this .
There &apos;s a second thing I like about this .
This is just street-up innovation .
They &apos;ll give you a new one .
I mean , that &apos;s buy three , get one free . That kind of thing .
They also write them in Hindi .
You can subscribe to these .
This is how it &apos;s shifting .
And this is from Delhi .
And there are four things .
The second thing is the immediacy of objects .
That &apos;s my feeling .
And why do I say it ?
Then hear this , please .
There &apos;s more .
Now , let &apos;s imagine a parallel .
Incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
And guess what ?
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
Seriously .
A hundred years ago , guess what ?
Margarine didn &apos;t exist .
There were no restaurant chains .
You just ate .
Vitamins had not been invented .
You ate food .
The cornflake hadn &apos;t been invented .
Goldfish swam .
Thus arrived convenience .
Healthy was another story .
It wasn &apos;t all bad .
We weren &apos;t all hippies , either .
Many people became fat-phobic .
Think of the frozen chicken nugget .
That &apos;s good .
Let me pose you a question .
I don &apos;t know .
We need to start acting .
Ann Cooper &apos;s right .
And that happens to be quite easy .
Eat real food .
Thank you .
Okay . So I &apos;m smiling .
Now I &apos;m frowning .
And this is really heavily backlit .
Okay , here we go .
Oh , it &apos;s so sad .
Those machines have no place for empathy .
So , we &apos;re involving two things .
I &apos;ve been doing that for about 10 years .
I have a monthly puzzle calendar .
I did puzzles for &quot; Bejeweled . &quot;
I thought this was a great assignment .
One hint : It &apos;s not &quot; L. &quot;
It could be an &quot; L , &quot; of course .
This is called a figure-ground illusion .
Here we have &quot; Day and Night . &quot;
Here we have &quot; figure &quot; in white .
It &apos;s all &quot; figure . &quot;
It &apos;s the same this way .
Thank you very much .
And here it is , figure-ground .
I &apos;ll just go one step further .
There is a game called Rush Hour .
Well , move the blue one out of the way .
The first move is going to be what ?
I wanted to make a sequel .
Created a whole bunch of levels for it .
But it takes some persistence .
And what does this add up to ?
Where is that ?
Okay , so that &apos;s the lens .
Anybody ?
Three , two , one , go !
Yay !
and technology was going to carry us along .
You needed to know that .
It &apos;s a fond memory of times past .
This is a big joke .
This is the audition for &quot; King Kong . &quot;
So thank you very much .
That &apos;s true even amongst peers .
Could we bring down the lights please ? Thank you .
So let &apos;s give this a try .
Terribly sorry . I forgot the floor .
Wake up .
Hey .
Come on .
Please .
Come on .
Ah , sorry about that .
Forgot this .
Give it another try .
Okay .
He figured out the system .
Uh oh .
All right . Let &apos;s try this .
Come on .
Hey .
You heard her , go ahead .
Bye-bye .
Thank you .
Good .
My dad was not alone .
600,000 people were displaced .
So -- -- so cool !
I like that , too .
This is my version of globalization .
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return .
Ciao bellos !
And I feel now like George Bush .
It &apos;s like &quot; mission accomplished . &quot;
Why did they not die ?
Mission accomplished !
Just look how many .
So this is where they are today .
They are now buying cars .
So there they are .
And what will happen in the future ?
Will they move on ?
Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing .
The colors show the continent .
The year is 1960 .
They are still up here .
And will it happen ?
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
Thank you very much .
It was venerable .
It was ubiquitous .
But it was a little bit boring .
He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors .
And for the most part , the stories are recycled .
So how do you survive ?
There &apos;s legal hustles .
You pay everything in stamps . Those are the currency .
You charge another inmate to clean his cell .
You want a dirty magazine ?
Thank you .
Come on , raise your hands .
Credit card , investment account ?
How about this week ?
This week ? Last week ?
It &apos;s good to see you guys .
So what does this tell us ?
In fact , it already is .
And it &apos;s working .
So what are we waiting for ?
Take a look at the Prius .
Thank you .
Miwa Matreyek !
Extremely , extremely isolated .
They orient to the caregiver .
There are those individuals who don &apos;t talk at all .
Autism creates itself .
So how do we do that ?
You &apos;re watching a video .
It &apos;s something very different .
That &apos;s not the idea .
Well thank you for listening to me .
And here &apos;s the worst news of all .
&quot; That &apos;s what I thought , &quot; she said .
I &apos;m proposing three planks .
Plank number one : Adapt all the time .
The conversation will go better . &quot;
Plank number three : Tell your story .
So how do you do that ?
My wife bought a flip chart .
What values do we most uphold ?
We are travelers , not tourists .
The answer , I believe , is yes .
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance .
It &apos;s a matter of choice .
The consumer is empowered .
Commodity prices are like this .
What is your strategy in your household ?
They are taking responsibility .
But that &apos;s not really the whole story .
Does anybody know why ?
As a result , déclassé consumption is in .
The management principle is dollars and cents .
A couple things that are kind of cool .
They &apos;ve just instituted dynamic pricing .
The consumer is demanding it .
And I &apos;ll give you a few examples .
Complete transparency .
Think twice before you have that bottle of wine .
They want these skills .
It &apos;s incredibly important right now .
Let &apos;s look at a couple of quick examples .
Crisis equals opportunity .
It will drive innovation .
Thank you very much .
I thought this was a little strange at the time .
I played a lot of chess .
So , he has four kids , right ?
Right , it &apos;s true .
But there &apos;s a middle ground , too .
So , three types of vision , right ?
Interactivity was another thing .
There were hypertext comics .
X , Y and also Z.
And notice what &apos;s going on here .
There we go .
Just one more .
Talk about your infinite canvas .
Why is this important ?
Thank you for having me .
I come out of the advertising and design business .
This is a real thing .
And there is some good news to report today .
I thank you .
And they would look that up .
Back in the old days , people used spreadsheets .
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
So Baxter is up here .
We &apos;ve got a conveyor there .
But with Baxter it doesn &apos;t hurt .
This is Mildred .
They &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
Thanks very much .
Jack Horner : Building a dinosaur from a chicken
I was fortunate in finding things .
I wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
Then I just pick things up .
So it was pretty interesting stuff .
And everybody &apos;s happy about that .
And then , then , then , and then ...
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
And so she thought , well , what the heck .
And that was really cool .
That was interesting .
But Mary went further .
She took the bone , and she dumped it into acid .
There were blood vessels left .
It was extraordinary .
The cells looked better .
The vessels looked better .
Found the protein collagen .
I mean , it was wonderful stuff .
Birds are living dinosaurs .
&quot; The chicken is not . &quot;
The chicken is a dinosaur .
I mean it really is .
&quot; Fix the chicken . &quot;
We have selection .
We also have transgenesis .
And that &apos;s pretty cool .
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
But there &apos;s another thing .
There &apos;s what we call atavism activation .
Snakes are occasionally born with legs .
And here &apos;s an example .
Now that &apos;s a good characteristic .
We can save that one .
We know we can use that .
We can make a chicken with teeth .
That &apos;s getting closer .
That &apos;s better than a glowing chicken .
He &apos;s looking for those genes as well .
And so he agreed .
It has the three fingers , the three digits .
And so what we &apos;re looking for is that gene .
And the same goes for the tails .
It &apos;s a cooler-looking chicken .
Why make this thing ?
What good is it ? &quot;
Well , that &apos;s a good question .
Thank you .
Today &apos;s its debut .
So fingers crossed .
And keep your eyes on the big screen .
He is an actor playing the part of a magician .
They are stories with a twist .
It &apos;s fun to be fooled .
They want to share the experience .
It keeps me busy .
It &apos;s a uniquely human achievement .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hi .
I did that for two reasons .
I &apos;m used to a stationary mic .
I just become skanky .
So I &apos;m sorry about that .
And I &apos;m already off-message .
You cannot turn them off with a switch .
We bring stories to the public .
They all need a face .
But you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
And they deserve better .
So there you are .
No fighting , ladies .
Genius !
We &apos;re in the middle of the process .
I miss Michael .
And I was thrilled .
No , that is not me .
I was so wasted . &quot;
That &apos;s a responsibility .
Hello !
What does that mean ?
Very simple stuff .
This is what it &apos;s about .
Huhh ! They &apos;ve been discovered by the sultan .
He will not be pleased .
Huhh ! And now the sultan is in danger .
Don &apos;t get me started .
Seriously .
He &apos;d smell it .
So how do we show this ?
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum .
Thank you .
Hi everyone . I &apos;m Sirena .
So I did a little research on it .
Well , this is what I found .
Oh , my gosh !
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
This is small and lightweight .
And you know what ?
The violin is very beautiful .
Yuk , yuk , yuk .
Like the multi-dimension stuff .
Thank you .
And it is .
The others were brothers , sisters .
I was married when I was 14 .
But we were all so nervous .
&quot; Why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
And then she was nervous .
&quot; Why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
You must be tolerant .
This is what I wanted to say .
I also knew that I &apos;m not alone .
So why was I stalling ?
Imagine your last hamburger .
Sound familiar ?
It &apos;s called weekday veg .
On the weekend , your choice .
Simple .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to start with a little story .
You may recognize her .
And here we go !
Thank you .
The Mola &apos;s no exception .
And how do you do that ?
And it &apos;s pictured right here , that little tag up there .
They &apos;re super industrious .
Photography threatens fantasy .
Kenny was born . He actually made it to adulthood .
This is the Death Star .
They flip the negative .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Innocents . &quot;
That &apos;s it . Thank you .
On and on and on .
Here &apos;s three values .
So how does it do so ?
Well , we asked thousands of people .
Here &apos;s what we found .
For example , personality .
Does any of this matter ?
It transforms our preferences .
It alters our personalities .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s make it concrete .
It &apos;s called the basket cell .
They &apos;re excitatory .
Now how are we going to do that ?
So how do we do this ?
So this turned out to be very simple to do .
So this is very powerful .
And so that &apos;s what happens .
Okay , there it goes . Right now .
So this is some work that we &apos;re doing .
So how are we going to solve this ?
Thank you .
Ed Boyden : That &apos;s right .
Right , yeah .
Enjoy , and thank you very much .
Because it looks like it might .
UE : It &apos;s a dream . It &apos;s a dream . Yeah .
And I believe soon .
Coming off of you ?
UE : Hopefully not .
and do you ever say , &quot; No , no I &apos;m not going to . &quot;
Colin Powell : Kids need structure
Do you understand ? &quot;
&quot; Huh ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , General . Yes , General . &quot;
I don &apos;t think so .
And they hate him .
I &apos;m telling you you didn &apos;t shave . &quot;
They come to respect him .
She &apos;s the one who feeds me .
It &apos;s her language I will learn . &quot;
That &apos;s when language begins .
And we &apos;re going to read to you . &quot;
It &apos;s predictable .
I was not a great student .
Straight C everywhere .
And then I found ROTC .
Yep .
And that &apos;s the key to success .
They never left .
They never did anything .
We are a nation of immigrants .
&quot; It &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot;
But I gotta have my hot dog .
And the scene repeats itself so often .
&quot; Yes , yes . &quot; &quot; Oh ... &quot; I hand him the money .
Thank you very much .
Hello .
And I would get harassed sometimes .
&quot; Get a job ! &quot;
It was consistent .
Is this fair ?
And I thought , this is fair .
This is this .
It &apos;s not for everybody .
Well , maybe it &apos;s for you .
I just want you to have this money . &quot;
Thank you .
And the goal was 100,000 dollars .
It &apos;s about 25,000 people .
They don &apos;t want to ask for things .
I see them as trust .
Thank you .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
And it &apos;s a pretty big building .
This is five times larger .
Right ?
But now we do .
Instead , they &apos;ve been hacked .
What the hell ?
All countries spy .
And maybe that &apos;s true .
Let &apos;s take , for example , Sweden .
And the answer is zero .
It &apos;s not balanced by any means , not even close .
It used to be end-to-end encrypted .
Then it was sold to the United States .
Today , it no longer is secure .
You shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
Well , it &apos;s not the war on terror .
Because that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . It &apos;s about privacy .
And surveillance changes history .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
Privacy is the building block of our democracies .
So , what is there to be done ?
Should we worry . No , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
How do you do that ?
Maybe you can do it together with other countries .
Thank you very much .
And this is City Hall Park .
Where do they get their food ?
So we just started making a list .
Or fire . Or dry soils .
And feed into that the map of the species .
Thank you very much .
And this woman is the star of the video .
She doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
This is on the 6 train in New York City .
I &apos;m wearing a hat . I &apos;m wearing a scarf .
And the girl &apos;s going to notice me right here .
We &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
So at this point , she decides to put the rape book away .
This goes on for another four stops .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
And we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
So I could do more large-scale projects .
So I got inspired by that .
This was completely unauthorized .
And I stood in the park giving signals .
You &apos;ll see that start right here .
There &apos;s a better photo of it .
So here &apos;s the video .
So again , this is 2005 .
This is the Best Buy in New York City .
But also , don &apos;t shop .
Just stand around and don &apos;t face products . &quot;
You can see them in this footage .
Thank you .
And one morning , I was riding the subway .
It &apos;s morning rush hour .
It &apos;s very cold outside .
Thank you .
And of course they don &apos;t .
It &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
We don &apos;t need a reason .
Thank you very much .
In my previous life , I was an artist .
We faced many challenges .
&quot; But why ? &quot; I asked him .
So it &apos;s time for change .
So we noticed change .
&quot; Come on , man ! What policemen ?
And this was not a misplaced feeling .
Crime did fall .
It &apos;s not about genes .
I tweet . I love it .
It &apos;s not just about politicians and laws .
We can all change the world .
Efharisto and kalinihta .
Clouds seldom visit this area .
And then it is 40 feet deep .
And this is pure drinking water .
It &apos;s two houses .
But here it is unwritten by law .
It can break sometimes .
And we request them .
And they are plaiting hair .
But it is invisible .
But this is not ground water .
This was done in 11th century .
And you have to go further down .
but not to create the engineering colleges .
The center of life is water .
These are the beautiful waves .
These are the trees .
Thank you very much .
Otherwise , it can &apos;t be done .
I teach high school math .
Students lack perseverance .
This is really destructive .
It applies equally to math .
I believe in real life .
So I hope you can see .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
And here &apos;s how it works .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
It &apos;s tedious .
This has been a lot of fun .
Math makes sense of the world .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
They are more dynamic .
This monster with big tentacles .
The private sector does a lot .
The Internet was crazy .
Thank you .
What is this ?
Should I try it ?
Try it !
What is it called ?
Fortune cookie .
There &apos;s a piece of paper inside !
What is this ?
You &apos;ve won a prize !
What is this ?
It &apos;s a fortune !
Tasty !
I love this dish .
He &apos;s in Taiwan right now .
I went to his home town .
And I went looking for chicken .
She &apos;s like , &quot; It &apos;s not ?
But you know what ?
It wasn &apos;t that .
Yeah . So , I went and started looking .
And this logo !
So . Thank you very much .
Daffodil Hudson : Hello ?
Yeah , this is she .
What ?
What are the dates again ?
Pen . Pen . Pen .
March 17 through 21 .
Okay , all right , great . Thanks .
Lab Partner : Who was that ?
DH : It was TED .
LP : Who &apos;s TED ?
Can I help you ?
DH : Right now ?
Stagehand : Break a leg .
Who are we ?
That is the big question .
And the Rift Valley is a depression .
Where did these things come from ?
He was very able to use stones effectively as tools .
It was truly exciting .
Dong Woo Jang : The art of bow-making
Why bows ?
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Airport security .
And let &apos;s see how this one works .
This is a bamboo bow , with 45-pound draw weights .
Did it strike you ?
Thank you .
How about this word ?
Here , I &apos;ll show it to you .
For one thing , I just do not do uniforms .
Well , I blame the Queen .
Why do I blame the Queen ?
There &apos;d be virtually no learning curve .
I mean , I &apos;m a huge geek , I love computers .
The design has not changed .
And OK , what about online dictionaries , right ?
Online dictionaries must be different .
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
We have a pan that &apos;s too small !
The English language is as big as it is .
Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; Oh , boy .
And I think this is a problem .
You can ask for help !
We &apos;re missing California from American English .
Where did it come from ? Who said it ?
What newspaper was it in ? What book ?
It dies too fast .
It &apos;s a format that died because it wasn &apos;t useful enough .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
Thank you very much for your kind attention .
I brought along with me an abalone shell .
And so here &apos;s the periodic table .
And I absolutely love the periodic table .
And you could basically do this a billion times .
I brought it here .
You can make lots of amplifications to it .
Thank you .
And at the time I was very superstitious .
So there are , of course , two different possibilities .
This is 1983 .
This is , you know , a book .
This is , you know , the movie poster .
So this is one .
You don &apos;t see the horizon .
He &apos;s from Korea originally .
And this was two weeks ago .
And then we did one more of these .
This is from the front .
Then it &apos;s : &quot; guts . &quot;
Then it &apos;s : &quot; always works out . &quot;
And it &apos;s &quot; me . &quot;
Thank you so much .
And he said , on the spot , &quot; Absolutely , yes . &quot;
You do it again and again .
We set out to do this .
And he wanted to go .
And what he said , for me , was very moving .
A few TEDsters here .
And a third .
And a seventh and an eighth .
He was so happy .
Thank you so much .
It &apos;s amazing .
Thank you .
This is an ambucycle .
He just needed someone helping him .
He could have saved this child .
I was a very stubborn kid .
He was on Coumadin .
He was bleeding from his neck .
We &apos;re not there to replace ambulances .
Something special happened .
No one is getting money .
And he saved my father .
It &apos;s very easy to adopt .
And we made a difference .
We all want to be heroes .
Thank you very much .
Glasses are not very expensive . They &apos;re quite plentiful .
Next step in my process .
Okay , so I &apos;ve made these glasses and ...
Okay , I &apos;ve made the glasses to my prescription and ...
... I &apos;ve just ...
But the cost has to be brought right down .
How do you solve this problem ?
You start to get into detail .
And the answer to that is research .
Take a look at this drawing .
Can you tell what it is ?
Why ?
The payoffs can be huge , though .
Thank you .
I &apos;m a filmmaker .
These are live bullets .
There is no need to use violence .
We can do it !
But that &apos;s true for adults too .
So they kept on going .
Thank you .
That &apos;s what mass marketing is .
It &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
They &apos;re made from &quot; cremains . &quot;
So my three stories .
Thank you very much for your attention .
This is a liter of oil .
And that gap continues to widen .
But the world isn &apos;t Second Life .
And it is something which has several characteristics .
Transitional is completely different .
Thank you very much .
&quot; People do stupid things .
Well , one or two brave souls .
Wonderful .
It &apos;s getting blunter and blunter .
&quot; So are you carrying a needle ? &quot;
This is a really easy problem .
There is nothing on the other side .
Now let &apos;s talk about sex .
It &apos;s not that easy !
No one wants it .
He &apos;s from Haiti and he has AIDS .
Of course not , of course not .
So these are data from Scotland .
Then it came way down .
This is of new infections .
What does that mean ?
What does it mean ?
Is that what &apos;s happening ?
Why does she do that job ?
Okay , Ines .
It &apos;s all politics .
Thank you .
So why is this important ?
But is it practical ?
I think it is .
It &apos;s keeping the lights on .
that &apos;s really history .
What &apos;s next ?
Thank you .
The reality is really , very different .
What does that mean ?
And where do they come from ?
And it &apos;s the same with nurses .
Mothers take care of the children , take care of the home .
So often the men are gone .
And everybody was quiet .
I &apos;m HIV-positive .
I &apos;ve been afraid to tell everybody . &quot;
We have to do that .
Mothers caring for mothers .
It &apos;s transformational .
Thank you .
And that &apos;s what I came up with .
I certainly haven &apos;t .
It &apos;s called sheep &apos;s organs .
Who keeps lettuces in their fridge ?
It &apos;s unscientific . It &apos;s unnecessary .
And , of course , sometimes there was a bonus for going .
So , we sucked up .
Now that &apos;s compassion .
Talk about a picture of compassion .
Just a photograph .
Arm in arm for struggle .
He insisted , &quot; I must go . &quot;
I know how you feel . &quot;
We were all suffering .
How do you make it real ?
This is a season of grace .
and not to have sex with anyone else , ever .
And the big day comes .
What are they doing right ?
What can we learn from them ?
Obvious , right .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
Here &apos;s an interesting one .
Oh no .
Do not win an Oscar for best actress .
I &apos;m serious .
Yeah .
So we have to keep an eye on that .
And we do like a cocktail or two .
I &apos;ll see you at the bar .
I have to say that I &apos;m very glad to be here .
And he kind of nodded , you know ?
It &apos;s , like , amazing , right ?
You feel for them .
I can never get in there .
It &apos;s like , yes , I can be free .
Design does that .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tap , Type , Write . &quot;
It has 10 variations .
There &apos;s a shift .
It &apos;s peaceful , like that .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And the shopkeeper would say , &quot; It &apos;s old . &quot;
&quot; Tell us more . &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s really old . &quot;
It &apos;s about something in between .
And also &quot; no love . &quot;
So that is authoritarianism .
I was born in 1976 .
Don &apos;t worry .
We have a big problem .
I think there &apos;s consensus on this .
Then we were victims of the French .
Hold on ! Wait a minute !
But it doesn &apos;t .
Mexico has cancer .
We &apos;re very afraid .
Less safe !
We need to confront this fear .
They say , &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
So what did they do ?
We &apos;ll be waiting for you right here . &quot;
They stayed there .
But he keeps fighting .
He keeps organizing .
He keeps mobilizing .
And they &apos;re out there !
What are we going to do ?
Today in Mexico we &apos;re asking for Gandhis .
We need Ghandis .
They can take a man &apos;s life .
Thank you .
Good morning !
Are you awake ?
He said , &quot; Sorry ? . &quot;
&quot; I do . &quot;
Is the French pronunciation correct ?
How could she speak that way ?
It made me mad .
It definitely hurts !
To be one of them ?
Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
This is one reality .
How ?
It doesn &apos;t ring a bell , does it ?
What is our intellect ?
How would you feel ?
I asked her once how things were going .
Does she want to commit suicide ?
No problem !
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
Creativity is the idea .
There &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
And I &apos;m being told the dynamic .
Snares on , snares off .
Just the basic feeling .
However , that is simply not enough .
And I &apos;m doing far , far less .
They &apos;re all different .
I have the sound coming this way .
If there were no resonators on here , we would have ...
Can you hear anything ?
Do you see what I mean ?
And this is quite interesting .
Audience : No .
Try again . Snow .
See , you &apos;re awake .
And that &apos;s exactly what he did .
We had to study from study books .
Hi there .
Okay .
Okay .
And it &apos;s actually in the machine .
Life can be messy .
Thank you very much .
We are OK Go .
Let me start again .
Tim &apos;s sundial hat .
Sorry , start again .
Dogs .
Or was Venus extremely hot ?
The physics does not change .
There would be no stable shoreline .
Does not enlarge government .
Thank you .
That &apos;s the heroic part of their story .
There &apos;s a flip side as well .
Thank you .
That &apos;s the other WTO .
They don &apos;t have a bucket or a box .
And that &apos;s her dad .
Poop &apos;s not particularly adequate .
Poop can cook your dinner .
It &apos;s got nutrients in it .
She &apos;s been suffering for years .
She &apos;d grown up with a latrine .
She was scared of snakes . She was scared of rape .
She left .
But not just that .
Things are going wrong here too .
Thank you .
Let me go right into the slides .
Can you turn off the light ? Down .
I like to be in the dark .
This is in Venice .
I got into fish .
It was pretty hard .
Couldn &apos;t find it .
So ...
I played with it in the evening .
It was a joke .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
He was the Swiss Army knife .
The highlight of the performance was at the end .
I had nothing to do with it .
People hate it .
And I &apos;m always drawn to that .
And that chain link is really expensive .
Of course , the milk can is his .
And he pushed that .
I just tell the stories .
And it &apos;s just a complex of factory buildings .
It &apos;s copper and galvanize .
And they end up looking like stone .
This is the central area .
There &apos;s a ramp .
He would send me a fax and show me something .
I don &apos;t want the tower . &quot;
And that &apos;s my cafeteria .
It &apos;s in the West Valley .
These are the models .
He was too busy .
Etc. etc .
You &apos;ve got the idea .
These people are art collectors .
I keep trying to make it work .
It &apos;s never been finished .
There &apos;s a railroad track .
You drive down .
And this would be a hotel .
It &apos;s hard to do high-rise .
And that &apos;s it , built .
The dome was a request from the client .
She didn &apos;t care where .
And it &apos;s very private .
These aren &apos;t focused very well .
I don &apos;t know how to do it from here .
Focus the one on the right .
It &apos;s up there .
Left -- it &apos;s my right .
That &apos;s the living room .
Servants &apos; quarters .
This is the bedroom .
We &apos;re doing some work for him .
Kind of a fun thing to do .
This is in Paris , along the Seine .
They call it the plan coupe .
These are the models for it .
Apartments , etc .
And the one on the left is pretty awful .
And it faces into a park .
And it &apos;s got a fish .
It &apos;s like a drug addict .
And then I do it .
There it is .
But it &apos;s the living room .
So far .
This is a shopping thing .
And another restaurant .
It &apos;s plaster and just zinc .
I know I &apos;m over time .
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall .
It &apos;s a complicated project .
It has a chamber hall .
But finally , there &apos;s a hotel there .
This was our original model .
That &apos;s the idea .
And we split these bridges .
Time goes on .
It didn &apos;t work .
Thank you very much .
They &apos;ve leapfrogged .
I want to talk about the election .
They asked this question .
There is a big difference .
I &apos;m a big fan of cities .
It &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
How about artistic beauty ?
No , I don &apos;t think it is .
Yes , hairstyling -- I insist on that .
Thank you .
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States .
One is called the general election .
The other is called the Lester election .
And here &apos;s the trick .
Okay . That &apos;s Lesterland .
The United States is Lesterland .
Now you say , really ?
Really .05 percent ?
Here &apos;s point number two .
So here &apos;s the model of government .
This is a corruption .
So the right wants smaller government .
But here &apos;s the bad news .
Block reform .
It feeds on dysfunction .
This is the root .
There will never be a Christmas .
Okay . So how do we do it ?
Now I get this skepticism .
But I don &apos;t buy it .
Irrelevant .
There &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
When she said that , I scrambled .
What is that sense of hopelessness ? &quot;
Nothing you can do . &quot;
So would I do nothing ?
Do you have that love ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Well , most of you anyway .
It was what he called &quot; fine-grained relinquishment . &quot;
The continental landmasses drifted around .
Ice cover waxed and waned .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s about a tenth of a millimeter .
That &apos;s how small that is .
This is a ring of cobalt atoms .
You have things like coral .
And you can see those in micrometeorites .
This was the first picture I took . It was kind of amazing .
This is a very small grain of sand , this whole thing .
And that &apos;s called a ring agglutinate .
Thank you .
Oops . Sorry .
Okay .
It &apos;s got a chin barbel .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
That chin barbel is flashing .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
They &apos;re things like this .
This is a golden coral , a bush .
It grows very slowly .
And these are flytrap anemones .
There are starfish that can make light .
We call it the electronic jellyfish .
So the camera &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high-resolution .
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
We &apos;re talking to something .
And this was very consistent .
And this is a burglar alarm .
&quot; Hey , wait a minute .
He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s persistent .
He keeps coming back .
Nope .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve talked for three minutes .
But let &apos;s suppose we did this .
So that &apos;s a large number .
We were very successful .
Human nature would have to change .
It &apos;s a pretty pathetic list .
Greater subjective well-being .
Conscientiousness and sympathy .
It &apos;s just a single gene .
Thanks .
I &apos;ve had some time to think it over .
What about time and gas ?
So , take , for example , the three-way intersection .
So , here &apos;s one . There &apos;s another one which I studied .
And so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
And you &apos;d still come out ahead .
So , it makes one wonder , &quot; Why is it there ? &quot;
So , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
So , why not use a yield sign ?
That would not work .
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
It &apos;s kind of shaped like a T , as in taking turns .
And there were a few .
This was a life as a craftsman .
We want to say , &quot; This is just the way it is .
It &apos;s just the way it is .
It &apos;s not a system .
and he wanted to get the data .
It fell in every hospital it went into .
And it &apos;s been slow to spread .
How did you do that ?
Thank you .
So this is a computer program .
They &apos;re cell-oriented .
There &apos;s a camera .
How few genes can I use ?
They &apos;re no good either .
And here &apos;s how we do it .
This is part of that genome .
Anyone know what this is ? What is it ?
It &apos;s China , right ?
And we started a studio .
I never -- I don &apos;t like plots .
I don &apos;t know what a plot means .
The letter C had other things in it .
They &apos;re not . &quot;
You don &apos;t even know .
Which I think I made up , which is a good thing .
So , shot dead , smacked over the head , you know , thrown away .
Well , not so awful .
There &apos;s consoling .
A complicated question .
And she said , &quot; I knew it was he . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to talk about that now .
And then I go and have some tea .
That &apos;s actually Hy .
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies .
They &apos;re exactly what they sound like .
So , how big ?
So that was very big .
The second things is very hot .
This is in false color .
It &apos;s actually X-ray light that we &apos;re seeing .
You were lied to .
And dark matter is no exception .
Well , how do we do this ?
Here is an image .
So , it &apos;s very funny .
Here is a computer simulation .
It &apos;s in a shopping mall , and it sells fish eggs .
This is what that looked like .
And it started to make me think about a couple of things .
And so I thought that was interesting .
Here it is .
And will you buy someone else &apos;s sample ?
Thank you .
What if the enemy finds out ? &quot;
Thank you .
I knew them both .
It was incredibly successful .
Everything started breaking .
There is no plan B right now .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
Thank you very much .
What would you guess ?
Five hundred dollars ?
Eighty-two dollars a night .
Eighty-two dollars a night .
Paid line standing .
Take the way we fight our wars .
For two reasons , I think .
One of them has to do with inequality .
That &apos;s one reason to worry .
Let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
You don &apos;t have to take it out of your budget .
Let &apos;s see by a show of hands .
Let &apos;s have a discussion .
What would be your reason ?
Who will get our discussion started ? Yes ?
Then they stop reading ?
And measure . And what would you measure ?
All right , what about that ?
It will work the same either way .
Our children go to different schools .
Here &apos;s why .
Thank you very much .
Jeff Hancock : The future of lying
It &apos;s been fantastic .
Make sure you pay attention to them .
You believed in your principles .
Then you &apos;ve also lied .
You weren &apos;t in a dead zone .
Let &apos;s forget about that guy , too .
All right , well , what about online dating ?
A lot of humans have lived since then .
I &apos;ll give you a moment to read through them .
All right . Very good . About half .
And how many of you think that B is ?
All right . Slightly more for B.
Excellent . Here &apos;s the answer .
Nobody knows .
And they finally agreed .
Continuous improvement .
But physicians have another characteristic .
This is happening in reality .
Why is that ?
Thank you .
This is the U.K. government spend .
That funds everything in the U.K.
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
It &apos;s of the moon Enceladus .
It &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
So , tiny moon .
It &apos;s a beautiful graphic .
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .
Well , there is .
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
And the electrons can only be in particular places .
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun .
That &apos;s quite an incredible prediction .
Well , this is a picture of it .
It &apos;s called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet .
It looks like Saturn because , of course , it is .
Just exploit it ; just build things . &quot;
Thank you .
So here &apos;s what I came up with .
And what about operating costs ?
And what about capital costs ?
And what about , just , the whole economic structure ?
Where else could we potentially put this system ?
There &apos;s lots of possibilities .
Thank you .
You &apos;re publishing it .
JT : Absolutely .
All right . Thank you so much .
JT : Thank you .
Bugs Bunny is my muse .
Narration : &quot; Budapest . &quot;
Narration : &quot; Some Days . &quot;
Very funny .
Narration : &quot; Forgetfulness . &quot;
I lived in New York City .
And we would visit each other .
It &apos;s called &quot; The Country . &quot;
Narration : &quot; The Country . &quot;
Who could sleep that night ?
BC : Thank you .
Narration : &quot; The Dead . &quot;
You &apos;re loved for just being you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thanks .
Janna Levin : The sound the universe makes
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
We can &apos;t see them directly .
They churn up debris in their surroundings .
It cannot hide behind the black hole .
They can see you .
Then it &apos;s gone .
It &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
Want to get away from the sound .
Both black holes are moving .
And then they &apos;re going to merge .
Now it &apos;s gone .
It might make a sound .
It &apos;s getting closer and closer , and in 20 ...
It &apos;s a terrible sound .
It &apos;s literally the definition of noise .
Thank you . Thank you .
You guys were amazing .
That &apos;s amazing .
There isn &apos;t . I &apos;ll tell you what .
And they all looked angry .
I mean , it &apos;s a nightmare .
It was so bad .
I couldn &apos;t shake it .
Can I have a sip of water ?
Thank you .
Good evening .
It &apos;s actually very hot .
What about Beijing ?
So why is that ?
And this is air temperature .
And how do we do that ?
We are not using fossil energies .
We are not borrowing energy from our neighbors .
And these beautiful umbrellas .
Thank you very much .
Shukran .
Alan Kay : A powerful idea about ideas
He would have a great time .
But how simple ?
Now let &apos;s go to young children .
&quot; What have you noticed about what you did ? &quot;
So that &apos;s what Lauren did .
Well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
Each time I click it , car turn .
And I can try steering the car here by ...
See this wheel &apos;s heading here ?
And it &apos;s interesting .
Student 1 : Ooh , this is nice .
Who &apos;s got the apple ?
Alan Kay : They &apos;ve got little stopwatches .
Student 2 : What did you get ? What did you get ?
Student 3 : 0.99 seconds .
Teacher : Drop . Class : Whoa !
But if I oppose gravity , here we go ... Oops !
One more .
Yeah , there we go . Yeah , OK ?
Thank you .
That &apos;s the first thing .
So are you all thinking ?
So , magnificent creature , isn &apos;t it ?
Who here thought of a bat ?
This is considered the Five Blessings .
Bats are also threatened in the U.S.
What about longevity ?
Nobody ? One ? How about 10 years ?
Some ? How about 30 ?
So ...
Now follow me , OK ?
One , two , three .
That is my grandfather .
I wouldn &apos;t need it .
I guess it &apos;s just like life .
We can interfere with the interface .
You don &apos;t say a prayer .
You don &apos;t write a psalm .
You don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
Thank you , TED .
My train was a heart attack .
What does that mean , my environment ?
We all have these .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
Oh , not so lucky .
And it &apos;s not in yours either .
Just look at that for a minute .
This is him on the screen .
I &apos;m going to log in .
And this is my brother &apos;s profile .
Wait , poor spinal capacity .
But I want more .
And here &apos;s another paper .
We let them share the data and exchange it .
This is not just graphics .
Terrifyingly accurate matching .
How did I not know ?
And I am thankful .
This one &apos;s more about the lyric .
&quot; The worlds are the important thing .
Actually you don &apos;t .
It &apos;s the same animal , at least .
For example ...
And the sum looks like this .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
I got up this morning at 6 : 10 a.m.
I was awakened once during the night .
What is this for ?
What should it be for ?
Thank you .
I was lost .
The world is fucked up .
Except maybe French people .
Whatever .
&quot; Oh , all right . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s cool . &quot;
What about art ?
Could art change the world ?
And at that time , I was not thinking about changing the world .
So that &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s on the Champs-Elysees .
I was quite proud of that one .
I know those guys .
Are they so different ?
We called the project Face 2 Face .
The experts said , &quot; No way .
The people will not accept .
&quot; It will be as big as your house . &quot;
Okay , for example , that &apos;s Palestine .
We &apos;re in Ramallah right now .
And then there was always a silence .
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
I just observed .
I was shocked .
All Brazil was shocked .
So I decided to go there .
And she said , &quot; You know what ?
We &apos;re hungry for culture .
We need culture out there . &quot;
But that &apos;s okay .
We kept traveling .
I mean , they want to know what you &apos;re up to .
Are you an NGO ? Are you the media ? &quot;
Art . Just doing art .
Don &apos;t you have color in France ? &quot;
This is art . &quot;
Then art becomes useful .
So the people kept it .
So I asked the people what happened .
&quot; Oh , that guy just moved . &quot;
Okay , India .
In India it was just impossible to paste .
&quot; Oh , you know , we &apos;re just doing art . &quot; &quot; Art ? &quot;
Of course , they were confused .
Thank you .
So we didn &apos;t get caught this time .
Okay .
But to get it , they would have to &#91; get &#93; it signed by one of the women .
We go back regularly .
That &apos;s Rio .
That &apos;s London .
New York .
They would be really useful . &quot;
And this starts right now .
Yes , everyone in the room .
Everyone watching .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Suzanne Lee : Grow your own clothes
So we start by brewing the tea .
And then we &apos;re ready to add the living organism .
And along with that , some acetic acid .
And this is a static culture .
It doesn &apos;t need light .
At this point , it &apos;s really heavy .
Make it hydrophobic .
There &apos;s no waste .
Thank you very much .
SL : Yes , it is .
Suzanne Lee .
The bee is not calling the shots .
And that &apos;s what the lawn was .
Ugh . Mini-Me .
Well , consciousness . &quot;
Well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
So , one day , cattle in a pen .
Put that in play .
This is how soil is created .
It &apos;s created from the bottom up .
Thank you very much .
So think about it .
So think about that .
And there &apos;s opportunities in a circular economy .
Let &apos;s take cotton .
The electricity is free .
Vote with your wallets .
Thank you .
So now we &apos;ve gone back in time .
If you want to pause it , you can pause it .
You can manipulate it yourself .
Thank you .
Your sequence and mine are slightly different .
What do you guys think ?
Yes ?
I think we should say it all together .
Everybody : I am more than my genes .
Right . All together now .
Everybody : I am my connectome .
This is the connectome of the worm C. elegans .
That &apos;s a lot of information .
But this is just a single neuron .
It &apos;s absurd .
What kinds of changes happen ?
Well , it &apos;s true .
What &apos;s in this picture ?
What else is in this picture ?
I hope not .
Thank you .
One billion people .
Imagine this scenario .
What would you do today ?
We call it Matternet .
First of all , the UAVs .
This is the key to the technology .
People there love this .
Thank you .
We call it patient capital .
Both sides are right .
The first one was miniaturization .
But that &apos;s obviously not enough .
I know it works .
Thank you .
Paul Moller : My dream of a flying car
And where is that going to lead you to ?
There won &apos;t be a third chance .
Thank you .
So I tried .
Chimborazo , right ?
Chimborazo !
I didn &apos;t know it .
Chimborazo !
Yeah .
Now that &apos;s something that increases sexual desire , possibly chocolate .
But not when they &apos;re together like that .
This is the boy in me getting lucky again .
He doesn &apos;t .
You can come back to Earth .
You return to where you started .
You can finish your game .
I found it myself .
That &apos;s pretty cool .
I didn &apos;t know that .
Chimborazo !
Thank you .
Let &apos;s not talk about breastfeeding .
It &apos;s our respect .
It is that simple .
A little break .
A little break .
His name is Norman . &quot;
Norman !
Norman !
Who knew ?
It gives you reference points .
Thanks very much . It &apos;s been an honor .
And it &apos;s this machine .
Isn &apos;t she fabulous ?
Infants don &apos;t respond to much .
Monkey has like you have .
The changes are massive .
It &apos;s that simple .
It &apos;s degraded .
It &apos;s not Japanese .
It &apos;s crap .
It creates a representation of language crap .
It can also happen in the brain .
So here we &apos;re looking at the normal distribution .
Noise is increasing in the brain .
Okay . Thank you .
Thank you .
I &apos;m thrilled to be here .
So that &apos;s kind of a bold statement .
So this material is silk .
They find their way to self-assemble .
And so what does that mean ?
So let me see .
But you can do other things .
And you can think of different formats .
I mean , why would you want to do all these things for real ?
Thank you .
So don &apos;t do that .
How do you do it ?
I often don &apos;t think about it .
It &apos;s just completely different .
Thanks .
Think of it like this .
Polarization rises .
So here &apos;s another asteroid .
Please raise your hands .
Thank you .
Now what could this mean ?
So what could this mean ?
Google &apos;s doing it too .
Thank you .
This time , he comes down .
Another three years .
And now I &apos;m going to kill the maggots ? &quot;
And then , third , you step from there to what is called &quot; a feeling of gratitude . &quot;
And so they get reborn as whatever , you know .
Thank you very much .
This is not regenerative medicine .
Why is this important ?
You can prevent .
Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance .
How can we do that ?
The first is cellular therapies .
This is the reality of diabetes .
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
This was a randomized trial .
There go the cells .
This is equally tragic .
It &apos;s very powerful work .
It &apos;s no coincidence .
The European Union , same thing .
China , the same thing .
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
Thank you .
Where &apos;d that come from ?
Trust me on that one .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
And I thought that was worth sharing .
I &apos;m a garbage man .
The more stuff that &apos;s mine , the better .
In fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
Most of it &apos;s incinerated or landfilled .
They have very different densities .
And they even have different colors .
And they extract the metals by hand .
I call this environmental arbitrage .
This is just one example .
And we eventually broke the code .
We have enormous energy savings .
They get to close the loop with their products .
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
Thank you for your time .
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
But help was coming .
And it took them four days .
Maps matter .
Welcome to the new world .
And it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
This is a picture called a cutaway .
And the hope was two-fold .
Steaming ought to be faster .
So here &apos;s another one .
Here &apos;s our hamburger cutaway .
I said , &quot; It would have to show up free . &quot;
It &apos;s a partial differential equation .
We also did a lot of calculation .
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it .
Isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
Anyway , here &apos;s the book .
Here it is .
2,438 pages .
And they &apos;re nice big pages too .
Here it is .
This number is small .
First off , what is it ?
So , what to do ?
Here &apos;s the idea .
And that would be that .
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
But there &apos;s a little secret .
I suspect the latter .
Thank you very much .
Well it &apos;s hard to say .
Holy cow ! That &apos;s just amazing .
Maybe some of these conversations can continue .
Yet , he was my greatest teacher .
Brah dada dadadadah . &quot;
And I thought , go figure .
They &apos;re locations in the spectrum of sound .
And in the 21st century ...
Mozart was the same way .
Ah , wicked , cruel fate !
Ah , baleful stars !
Ah , avaricious heaven !
I find it such a profound one .
What happens when the music stops ?
Nobody knows .
Thank you .
Thank you .
That &apos;s a huge problem .
Older people have that experience .
Younger people don &apos;t .
Thank you .
And it &apos;s everywhere .
First , don &apos;t become a cannibal .
Just a little .
Thank you .
So let &apos;s begin with a group of images .
We &apos;re looking for something more .
Well , this image you &apos;ve all seen .
There &apos;s another kind of crucifixion .
Let &apos;s go back a little .
Did the images change the world ?
I have one image in my office .
Here it is .
And thank you to all the photographers .
He had a huge ambition .
He couldn &apos;t eat .
How true for Lincoln .
Three things had combined to lay him low .
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal .
So he put the pen down .
His story would be told .
He was a great storyteller .
But it was too late .
&quot; What do you mean ? &quot; they said .
It &apos;s not a sin . &quot;
I told the priest right away .
And he said , &quot; To whom did you wish harm ? &quot;
&quot; Oh yes , &quot; I said .
Thank you .
I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
I feel so fortunate .
It &apos;s a true feeling .
I said , &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; A job . &quot;
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; What do I do ? &quot;
She said , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
You know the one .
You know that teacher ?
I &apos;m not here alone .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There are four countries around the board .
And each country has a cabinet .
That &apos;s not all .
I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
And so I apologize to them as well .
That &apos;s a breach there .
And we were very upset .
We have a letter in the game .
It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot;
She read two sentences .
I was in tears .
We all lose .
He &apos;s been in many battles .
But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend Brennan .
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
There was no way they could win .
I &apos;ve failed them .
The parents were looking in the window .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
Will you accept it ? &quot;
And there are three seconds left on the clock .
And the game is won .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about warfare .
If only .
You have to have legal structure .
You have to have physical structure .
This is called a power-law distribution .
It &apos;s actually quite entertaining .
Right ? Bad hire . Right ?
Stay-at-home moms . Right ?
Here &apos;s another example .
It &apos;s going to be much more complicated than that .
Thank you very much .
And I have a dream .
More is bad .
They &apos;re Latin American .
Costa Rica .
That is longer than in the USA .
They are the happiest place .
What &apos;s going on there ?
They have the social connectedness .
It might be Latin American .
This is not the very distant future .
The second one is be active .
The third one is take notice .
Keep learning .
Human beings want to be happy .
Well , it has its pluses and minuses .
Politics have defined our lives .
We are in a position of danger .
Art is our weapon .
Culture is a form of resistance .
I am a nomadic artist .
Now I am making films .
These are some of the images of the coup .
Thank you so much .
And you have to tell me which one .
Really ? Okay .
Pretty even split .
Let &apos;s find out what the reality is .
Here is the orange one .
Here is the green one .
And here is the gray one .
So , this is pretty amazing , actually , isn &apos;t it ?
Can anyone see it ? Anyone ? No ?
And now you see it .
They are identical in every single way .
There is no inherent meaning in information .
Audience : &quot; Can you read this ? &quot;
&quot; You are not reading this . &quot;
&quot; What are you reading ? &quot;
So you don &apos;t do it again .
So why don &apos;t you do that now ?
Can I have the lights up again ?
That &apos;s your new normal .
And the same thing over on the right .
They are the same . Okay ?
How do you know ?
The answer to this question is no .
And here she comes down the ladder .
Now , are they getting it wrong ?
Okay , this is complete rubbish .
He finds it . Amazing . Right ?
And this is one of those images .
And this is what it sounds like .
So , a six-year-old child . Okay ?
So what I &apos;d like to finish with is this over here .
So , if we have the lights down .
Agreed ? Yes ?
Let &apos;s pull the covers off .
Do they look the same ? No .
So , thank you very much .
Imagine that you run a cafe .
It &apos;s mid-morning , the place is filling up .
Show us everyone who &apos;s available .
It &apos;s found 31 workers .
Let &apos;s make it personal .
How do I make that happen ? &quot;
Oh , that &apos;s going to be a disaster waiting to happen .
Not necessarily .
Let &apos;s take Britain as an example .
I believe we could .
So government then exits the frame .
This is now in the hands of the consortium .
It doesn &apos;t bother the taxpayer necessarily .
Is it worth their while ?
Does that sound improbable to you ?
Thank you .
David Pogue : The music wars
And she said , &quot; Well , one . &quot;
&quot; Good . &quot;
&quot; Cut . Cut . That won &apos;t do .
&quot; Not good . &quot;
We &apos;d better give you a real sound bite .
This time you can have three words .
No one works on that .
So that was not good .
And it turns out there &apos;s one way .
They don &apos;t spend time alone .
Len is an introvert .
But it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
You have intense concentration .
Hated the job .
She &apos;s working her way through college .
Now obviously she failed .
The second path is eudaimonian flow .
And the third path is meaning .
It &apos;s being done in a rigorous manner .
Close your eyes .
The person has to be alive . OK .
Now , OK , you can open your eyes .
And our results surprised us , but they were backward of what we thought .
But they were empty .
But you have to have the right tools .
You see that really salty Play-Doh ?
Well , it conducts electricity .
And this is nothing new .
And that sugar dough ?
So what does that mean ?
I plug in again the power to it .
I can start plugging in lots of lights .
It &apos;ll dim .
Have fun . Thank you .
And I was so stimulated .
And the man said , &quot; No , who ? &quot;
We &apos;ve had others .
And there &apos;s one that I want to talk about .
He was a man of tremendous leadership .
He had the favor of God with him .
There were many problems still left .
Where does it come from ?
How do we solve it ?
And revolutions ?
But he made this statement .
We are a soul .
It &apos;s the part of you that yearns , really , for God .
And he surprised me with the answer .
I talk ad lib .
We see people on our screens .
But death is inevitable .
I said , &quot; We &apos;re all going to die .
There &apos;s a time to be born , and there &apos;s a time to die .
Was there a God ?
It passes so fast . &quot;
He put it on a personal basis .
And I said , &quot; Sir , I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; So do I. &quot;
I &apos;m the embodiment of all truth . &quot;
He was a liar .
Or he was insane .
Which was he ?
I had to make that decision .
I couldn &apos;t prove it .
Richard Wurman : You did it .
Thanks .
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
&quot; Here on holiday are you , dear ? &quot;
&quot; Come to visit the children ?
How long are you staying ? &quot;
Could there be a connection ?
Well I don &apos;t know .
That is a little bit too early .
Okay .
And why not ?
Well , I don &apos;t think so .
I don &apos;t think so .
Okay .
It &apos;s all in English . &quot;
Case in point , Einstein .
Now it &apos;s exploded .
There are lots and lots of tests of English .
It &apos;s a circular thing .
Okay .
So bingo , problem solved .
Mind your language .
Thank you very much .
Okay . I do too .
This is one way to do it .
Water is energy intensive .
Thank you very much .
My daddy , he calls me all the time . &quot;
The wisdom lives inside of them .
They were dressed to the nines .
They acted sweet .
They acted silly .
&quot; Why not ? &quot; the girls asked .
&quot; And come in shackles ?
They hugged .
They laughed together .
It was beautiful .
Even the guards cried .
And bees are very faithful .
We have bumblebees on the top .
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what &apos;s there .
And I encourage you to look at that .
And so I went out .
People were out .
The city was there .
So I took heart in seeing that .
Well , it was the whole city .
And the old one looked like this .
That little list there would change .
I had no idea .
No , that &apos;s not true .
I &apos;ll go very quickly .
Now this is a very interesting thing .
And it creates a kind of planned emergence .
Thanks a lot .
Namaste . Good morning .
I &apos;m very happy to be here in India .
My mind was so shattered .
I want to change the verb .
And she was holding her baby .
And she said , &quot; Well , now , I need a house . &quot;
She has literally become deputy mayor .
She &apos;s changed the rules .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t go to school .
And that is the power of transformation .
I am an emotional creature .
I know when a storm is coming .
I am an emotional creature .
I am an emotional creature .
These feelings make me better .
I am an emotional creature .
It &apos;s like the older women somehow forgot .
I am an emotional creature .
I am an emotional creature .
I am your remaining memory .
I can take you back .
Nothing &apos;s been diluted .
Nothing &apos;s leaked out .
Can you say it with me ?
Thank you very much .
The punch line ?
And it made me suspicious .
Coincidence ? No , it &apos;s creepy .
There &apos;s a rumble in my stomach .
Marge Simpson : Homer , please .
Rives : Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
Well , how could it have ?
We might not ever know .
It could get awkward , right ?
In generations .
This was a perfect introduction .
You can read the text .
Then they switched to a magnetic drum .
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK .
&quot; No use , went home . &quot;
Burning lots of midnight oil .
&quot; Found trouble in code , I hope . &quot;
&quot; Code error , machine not guilty . &quot;
&quot; A short -- do not turn the machine on . &quot;
I know when I &apos;m licked . &quot;
&quot; Machine run , fine . Code isn &apos;t . &quot;
And sometimes things are okay .
He had a wonderful rapport .
They have to have something .
And they did start to evolve .
And he went around the country after that .
And could you do it again now ?
You know , could we get them running ?
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening !
And we owe a tremendous credit to that .
And that &apos;s the end .
Thank you very much .
The new me is beauty .
This is neat .
I mean , it &apos;s just wonderful .
And that &apos;s my new life .
It &apos;s beautiful and it &apos;s functional .
No . But is it fun ?
Yeah ! Yeah .
Or look at Google .
And it &apos;s just clever .
So , OK .
It was third .
Oh well , different story .
Buy it anyway .
It &apos;s round , it &apos;s neat .
The controls work wonderfully .
No problem .
And I couldn &apos;t force myself across that .
She brought students in to solve problems .
Still can &apos;t reach it .
Would you like the box of candy ? &quot;
You &apos;ve got be anxious .
No big deal .
It &apos;s all about the visceral experience .
The water then seeps over the tea .
Emotion is all about acting ; emotion is really about acting .
It &apos;s being safe in the world .
It &apos;s that little voice in your head that &apos;s the seat of consciousness .
But it &apos;s ugly .
The other neat thing ...
So that &apos;s the new me .
This first one &apos;s called &quot; the lean . &quot;
&quot; The stretch . &quot;
That is actually the device .
Look around you .
This one I love .
Thank you .
I grew up in the Midwest of the United States .
Actually , no .
What is the average difference here ?
The survey takes over a day .
Well , think about smoking , for example .
Thank you very much .
So first of all , what is a Tasmanian devil ?
And the next image I &apos;m going to show is quite gruesome .
She hadn &apos;t eaten for days .
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms .
Natural selection is survival of the fittest .
It evolves .
This is Jonas .
I took these back to the lab .
Think about that for a minute .
Well the answer is , it has .
This is Kimbo .
This cancer is remarkable .
Thank you .
That was the great eureka moment .
I think that &apos;s just fantastic .
Now then .
Etc .
Well done .
Fantastic chap .
Would you like to hear me play ?
He &apos;s sitting there .
So get out your pen and paper .
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
Nobody wants to do this .
We have not had an idea .
What would be the price ?
And so on .
We called them the &quot; dream team . &quot;
That is what economists do .
They prioritize .
These were the bad projects .
Why is it it came up ?
That &apos;s a substantial amount of money .
Yet it would do very little good .
One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
There are many problems out there in the world .
It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
I &apos;m all for that .
Thank you .
I know that beat .
It is lifeless .
I know intimately that skin you are hitting .
I will not kill for you .
Especially I will not die for you .
Everyone can be wrong .
I will craft my own drum .
Our humming will be drumming .
I will not be played .
This heartbeat is louder than death .
A bunch of pacifists .
I understand .
I &apos;ve been wrong a lot lately .
Like a lot .
Poetry does that .
Hold her now with you .
Are you holding her ?
This is &quot; Break Clustered . &quot;
All holy history banned .
Whose son shall it be ?
We cherish corpses .
Bitches get beat daily .
Profits made , prophets ignored .
Rhythm is half silence .
Sickness , health , tender violence .
I never was pure .
Girl spoiled before ripened .
Language can &apos;t math me .
I experience exponentially .
Everything is everything .
One woman loses six .
One woman loses her head .
One woman gives birth to a baby .
One woman never did .
Where do refugee hearts go ?
Faced with absence .
My spine curves spiral .
Cluster bombs left behind .
De facto landmines .
A smoldering grief .
Harvest contaminated tobacco .
Harvest bombs .
Harvest baby teeth .
Harvest palms , smoke .
Harvest witness , smoke .
Resolutions , smoke .
Salvation , smoke .
Redemption , smoke .
Breathe .
Do not fear what has blown up .
Thank you .
It makes you a little nauseous .
Thank you .
I love theater .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
All right . Let &apos;s start with theater .
Thank you .
And here are some excerpts .
Thank you .
Something happened along the way .
And Zero wants to go to the moon .
There is a revolution .
It &apos;s motion and emotion .
It &apos;s information .
It &apos;s happening .
Thank you .
So , embryonic stem cells are really incredible cells .
We &apos;ve got to look at the big picture .
It &apos;s an automated robotic technology .
Thank you .
That &apos;s peer-to-peer .
That is the diversity of what &apos;s going on .
Back to this spectrum .
Together , we can .
Thank you .
This is from Marlboro country .
This is a turquoise lake .
A meditator .
So now , we are going to speak of happiness .
We like the ups and downs of life .
And that can also come from some kind of confusions .
Now , what , then , will be happiness ?
You hit the solid rock .
So now , how is that ?
There are some which are adverse to this well-being .
Consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it .
You can have ugly faces , beautiful faces in the mirror .
Benevolence , loving kindness against hatred .
Each time it goes to the object , it reinforces that obsession or that annoyance .
Look at anger itself .
But that &apos;s the only way to go .
Now , here with 256 electrodes .
We love to do jogging , fitness .
One year later , how she is .
Flying monks .
Thank you very much .
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
&quot; Know thyself . &quot;
Think of the term we use , &quot; Retreat . &quot;
And eventually that vacation &apos;s got to come to an end .
I say the answer is yes .
And that was responsiveness .
So you use it with your headset .
This is for real .
This is not a fake .
I like to call this &quot; intra-active . &quot;
Would you get a divorce ?
Thank you .
Let me give you an example of this .
Here &apos;s another couple .
All right , so what does this mean ?
And the short answer is games .
And we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior .
Thanks for having me .
Three times .
Nope .
Three main approaches .
It &apos;s time for me to let it go .
Maybe a little more time ? &quot;
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
I know I don &apos;t need it .
What &apos;s in yours ?
Thank you .
But it &apos;s not only that .
But design -- oh , my God .
They &apos;re quite beautiful .
And that makes sense .
Thank you .
Hans Rosling : Asia &apos;s rise -- how and when
And on that axis I have life expectancy , the health of people .
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
India was trying down here .
United Kingdom is going down .
Not much has happened .
And we are moving into the new world .
And what happened ?
Children started to go to school .
Health services were provided .
And they were catching up indeed .
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here .
And the market reformer was successful there .
There they are today .
Shanghai is already there .
And that is not a bad thing , in itself .
Oh , they broke my frame .
It &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
Now , back to my projections .
Look at , look at the United States .
Can you see the bubble ?
You see it came down there .
They seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know .
You see , Japan did it like that .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
Can be worse , can be better .
It &apos;s always difficult to predict , especially about the future .
I think I &apos;m in a difficult position here .
But what I &apos;m really worried about is war .
Get your bookings in time . Thank you very much .
You really would be kind of out of luck .
The computer was cracked open .
And it works in a very particular way .
And there &apos;s several ways of doing this .
Thank you .
Thank you .
The fact is that we &apos;re living longer .
But it &apos;s actually not a new field .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Culture of Organs . &quot;
Plus we have stem cells .
This is actually a biomaterial .
You saw the spray going in .
We then put it in this oven-like device .
That &apos;s what you see here on the right side .
And this actually shows that printing .
Put a pair of gloves here .
Thank you .
Go backwards .
So , these gloves are a little bit small on me , but here it is .
Has a little bit of consistency to it .
I felt so sick .
I was able to wrestle in high school .
Luke , come up please .
I pulled them aside .
Thank you so much .
TS : Yeah .
JH : I agree .
TS : No .
JH : Thanks guys .
JH : Whoa . That is ...
ooh , nice .
TS : So something like this .
JH : That &apos;s fantastic .
It &apos;s really manifested there .
There are lots of things that appear .
So I think , conceivably , those could be predictive .
It just has so much in it .
TS : Thank you , John .
And I &apos;m thinking , no , this is not possible .
It &apos;s thrilling .
Who are these people ?
They are domestics .
So , two examples .
A couple of principles : build small .
A couple of years later , I meet them .
Something I truly believe .
300 to 500 million cases are reported .
A lot of hurdles .
Here are just some pictures of the factory .
Their women .
Thank you .
Thank you . Ooh , I &apos;m like , &quot; Phew , phew , calm down . Get back into my body now . &quot;
I think we will play another tune now .
Good morning .
So , what do you think ?
Let &apos;s find out .
But no faces ?
And here they are .
So that &apos;s just what we did .
They dressed differently ; they were different people .
But here &apos;s Honey .
So we said , this looks bad .
Donate it , take it , and so on .
So see what your intuition is here .
They actually tend to go a little risky .
So what &apos;s going on ?
And so this is what this looks like .
And so what do the monkeys do ?
So what does all of this mean ?
You can &apos;t just shut that off .
And here &apos;s the rub .
Thank you .
And I did .
It &apos;s unaffordable globally .
Don &apos;t you in the front row worry or anything .
This is a portable ultrasound .
All right , I gotta gel up .
And actually , can you see Libby ?
Thomas Batuik : Hi there , Eric .
You look busy . How are you ?
Okay , that &apos;s good . How about up a little bit ?
Should I do that again ?
TB : Yeah , let &apos;s do that .
It &apos;s not something I was very happy about .
This was me in third grade .
Now the software is also getting smarter , right ?
And I have these palpitations that are showing up .
I wept the day I graduated .
And here &apos;s the most important part .
I only had one night in the hospital .
Ah , isn &apos;t that cool ?
The front wheels rotate like this .
The cable over there , that &apos;s an optical fiber .
So , it &apos;s an open loop control .
It is not remote controlled .
So , this is last year in China .
This is this year in Austria .
There you go . Yes !
Thank you .
And again , you &apos;ll be able to see it in the lobby .
Where do we get this spark of imagination ?
And then I think , &quot; Ah this is cool . &quot;
Nobody criticizes any opinion .
Math , differential equations .
So , education is very important .
I love the Internet .
It &apos;s true .
So let me show you something .
This here is Brain .
Let &apos;s take a look .
All right .
Now , 1986 .
Now it &apos;s 2011 .
And I knocked on the door .
You want to guess who opened the door ?
I asked them why .
And they &apos;ll actually pay you money for those computers .
Nobody knows where they are .
Let me give you an example .
But just keep staring at it .
It &apos;s not used for anything .
I got zero hits ; wasn &apos;t there .
Because he blogged about the car .
He actually had a car accident .
Thank you very much .
A parachute jump from the very edge of space .
More about that a bit later on .
But it wasn &apos;t always that way .
Here &apos;s a bit more .
Not today .
Being run over is never easy .
And testing breakaway signpost pillars .
They did it by remote control .
That &apos;s the piston that was fired out of the floor .
It &apos;s such fun !
Not the cardboard box , but the green screen .
And that &apos;s Centre Point in London .
There were three jumps .
They first dropped some dummies .
This is him in a pressure suit .
You need a pressure suit .
They &apos;re just so , so delicate .
And what must that feel like ?
I did quite a lot of research .
That &apos;s in New Mexico .
That &apos;s the U.S. Air Force Museum .
Well there &apos;s a little bit more to it than that .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m confident that we &apos;ll find one .
Well that was not by me .
What it all boils down to is , of course , the sun .
So you begin with focal glow .
And it is all about this planet .
So here it is .
So just to explain .
Thank you .
We can go further .
Is it really needed ?
They are not disturbed anymore .
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting .
Thank you very much .
I want to warn you about that .
That &apos;s just human nature .
So , there &apos;s still work to be done .
It &apos;s not going to save the world .
Are you on the edges of your seats here ?
This won &apos;t hurt . Okay .
That &apos;s a non-zero-sum game .
So , I think that &apos;s good .
This isn &apos;t only about religion .
So this takes care of my age .
This was about 1925 .
After that , it had to be kneaded . It had to then go in , kind of , a mangle .
I remember that it was quite successful .
And that was in Hamburg .
This was my first job .
Eva Zeisel : Are you sure ?
Moderator : Yes , I am sure .
Weren &apos;t you there recently ?
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
This is the bacterial Esperanto .
I want to thank you for inviting me here .
Thanks .
Does anybody remember these ?
This costs , anybody guess ?
Audience : 65 dollars .
How many people know about XML ?
We &apos;re at the long tail end here .
So , thanks very much .
So I did some research .
And I found that there was an historic precedence .
But on the inside , it &apos;s anything but .
Take this place for example .
This is in Long Island , New York .
And so there is a good reason for this .
Museum quality .
Thank you very much .
It is really a sacred space .
You really are alive right here in this moment .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
If you played an E.
And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
And we won &apos;t react to it .
It was an opportunity that was missed .
So there is no mistake .
It &apos;s a very purifying experience .
You have some people who do .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
This is a science of listening .
Thank you .
I &apos;d like it back .
It was extinct .
Thank you .
We found carnivorous kangaroos .
That was not what happened , actually .
I put a team together .
We were very excited .
They &apos;re related distantly to thylacines .
Is this a risk ?
And the answer is no .
The grasslands were sweeping away .
And this one interests me .
And I &apos;m positive it wouldn &apos;t .
Thank you .
So it &apos;s more disordered .
This led me to blood .
And I found these maps which you see here .
Everyone showed up .
This is a girls &apos; bedroom .
Thank you .
This is one of my first book works .
So books really are alive .
Thank you .
Okay , so most of you are .
Right ?
Why phosphorus in particular ?
Let me explain .
You &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s wasteful .
Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus .
Do we have a solution ?
Less and less phosphorus will be available .
What should we do ?
True symbiosis .
That &apos;s completely natural .
Thank you for your attention .
Seventeen doesn &apos;t divide by two .
It doesn &apos;t divide by three .
It doesn &apos;t divide by nine .
You get 17 .
We &apos;re all one family .
That &apos;s the question .
It &apos;s actually surprisingly simple .
It &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s simple .
The secret to peace is us .
It &apos;s very easy to react .
Human beings -- we &apos;re reaction machines .
The conversation got back on track .
Question is : where &apos;s the third side there ?
Let me just ask you one question first .
Just out of curiosity , how many of you ?
And here , it &apos;s so far away .
Is it the number of deaths ?
Stories are the key .
What is terrorism ?
And that was my thinking of how would you do that .
And that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
We did our due diligence .
Let me ask you a question .
It brought us hope .
And so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
She &apos;s desperately poor .
They sit on the floor .
She doesn &apos;t even have a tablecloth .
What would the oak tree look like ?
It was done in South Africa .
It was done in Northern Ireland .
It simply depends on us .
That &apos;s a third side act .
The third side is us .
Thank you very much .
And that was what I did .
The wind blew very strong .
It &apos;s one of those things .
And they tasted really good .
And that &apos;s everywhere .
It &apos;s a bit of an embarrassment .
That &apos;s the same species .
And then this is amazing .
All that white coral .
But what does that mean ?
We really don &apos;t know .
That doesn &apos;t sell .
Thank you .
I &apos;m a believer .
That has got to be stopped .
And it continues .
There are 12 .
Do we have a corner on the market ?
That &apos;s not sustainable .
So where do we go from here ?
Does that continue ?
Yes , it &apos;s going to continue .
That &apos;s not sustainable either .
They &apos;re over .
That has nothing to do with it .
The oil is priced off the margin .
We &apos;re headed to natural gas .
It &apos;s 25 percent cleaner than oil .
It &apos;s going to be simple to accomplish this .
It &apos;s what we use a year .
There are eight million of them .
I &apos;m back to theorist again .
Thank you .
Thanks for that .
What happened ?
And so the margin is natural gas .
Today it &apos;s two dollars and forty cents .
In a nutshell that &apos;s what happened ?
TBP : That &apos;s what happened .
This stuff is everywhere .
It &apos;s my life .
Now I do own stocks .
Don &apos;t I wish .
But I also am in the fueling business .
So you believe in the threat of climate change .
Where are we headed ? &quot;
Does that make sense ?
I think it &apos;s closer to a billion .
There isn &apos;t anything wrong with nuke .
You can &apos;t -- okay .
Is that a concern ?
Fracking .
TBP : I &apos;m teasing .
There &apos;s no problems .
TBP : How do we get there ?
Thank you so much .
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been divorced ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
The boxes are too narrow .
And this can get really dangerous .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
I kept up the charade for eight years .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
No one is exactly shocked .
I was not an activist .
It might give them pause .
And then we made this .
It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
Visibility really is key .
In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
It &apos;s too late .
Thank you .
This is globalization .
What &apos;s the reason for it ?
That &apos;s what we tell them to do .
This is just nonsense .
In my day job , I &apos;m a policy adviser .
We don &apos;t like to change .
But of course , there are exceptions to that .
Otherwise , we &apos;d never get anywhere .
It was 6.8 .
I haven &apos;t got time to explain in detail .
What do we mean by good ?
Best is something different .
And the winner is Ireland .
What does this mean ?
Finland ranks pretty much the same .
They &apos;re also all rich .
This is not about money .
This is about attitude .
This is about culture .
I &apos;ll allow you to do that .
Now that &apos;s the Good Country Index .
What &apos;s it there for ?
I &apos;m not asking a lot .
And everybody will welcome you .
Thank you .
Hit me .
It &apos;s very flat , kind of rigid .
&quot; What are you going to teach me about right and wrong ?
You think you know right and wrong ?
No , don &apos;t just give me an example .
I want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong .
What is that idea ?
What makes something wrong ?
We are here for knowledge .
And something changes for Tony .
I want to know what is wrong .
I want to know what I know . &quot;
So Tony starts doing his homework .
Turns out , Tony &apos;s got the philosophy muscle .
Let us think about that . &quot;
And I say to Tony , &quot; Let &apos;s do this . &quot;
Thank you .
None of your media got it right .
We believe in risk awareness .
What does that mean ?
Not a complicated thing .
It was also about a business opportunity .
Will government change ?
Well I &apos;ll give you my straight talk about this .
Thank you .
So you can see my confusion here .
I &apos;m not an actor .
He was already dead !
We didn &apos;t have to divide our tasks .
We didn &apos;t have to communicate verbally about this .
It all just happened .
And it was like a lightning bolt .
Let &apos;s look at it .
It waits for its turn , it analyzes everything , it plans .
Whatever that means .
Sounds painful .
It only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more .
I think .
We are wired for that .
So , a lot of bobbing head .
Thank you .
My name is Kate Hartman .
And it &apos;s pretty simple .
Don &apos;t be ashamed .
It &apos;s fairly self-explanatory .
What kind of an experience do they have ?
And I thought , &quot; Well , hey !
The glaciers are actually leaving us .
Thanks .
This is a picture here taken from orbit .
Oh , it &apos;s going to be so much fun .
There were a couple of examples here .
OK , thank you very much .
More about that later , OK .
So all of these galaxies are moving .
We call this gravitational lensing .
And so , this is your instrument , OK .
But ignore the top part .
And the answer is yes .
They &apos;re not necessarily moving through space .
They just pass through anything .
We are always chasing storms .
This is a brain .
Think about that .
And that &apos;s exactly what they do .
How far can we take it ?
And you can see an image produced by this consortium .
Thank you .
So this is what happens as that burn gets going .
It &apos;ll just bake your retinas .
Oil doesn &apos;t sink , it floats .
I am helpless over this . &quot;
That shows you how bad it is .
And that &apos;s actually very perverse .
There were no lips .
And then there &apos;s this guy , okay .
So I &apos;m saying this is kind of a distraction .
You have these pictures of birds .
They really influence people .
It started Earth Day .
That &apos;s a lot .
So , three million barrels a day .
Thank you .
Time flies .
Why did I do it ?
They brought all sorts of different computers with them .
And these were all incompatible .
It was just very frustrating .
Well , some people did .
That &apos;s what it was like then .
And you did .
Thanks .
Well , documents you read , OK ?
Data is relationships .
So that &apos;s it , really .
That is linked data .
So , linked data .
The meme went out there .
Let &apos;s think about data for a bit .
We want unadulterated data .
Can you say &quot; raw &quot; ?
Audience : Raw .
Tim Berners-Lee : Can you say &quot; data &quot; ?
Audience : Data .
T Can you say &quot; now &quot; ?
Audience : Now !
T Alright , &quot; raw data now &quot; !
Audience : Raw data now !
It &apos;s very very important .
But , that &apos;s not true .
Bing ! Relationship . Data .
I did that . Me !
And that is what linked data is all about .
And we &apos;ve practiced that .
OK , so it &apos;s called linked data .
I want you to make it .
I want you to demand it .
Thanks .
At least once a week .
What &apos;s stopping you ?
I &apos;m not done yet . I &apos;m not done yet .
Now my topic is gratefulness .
But think again .
It &apos;s gratefulness that makes you happy .
And how does it work ?
It &apos;s just given to you .
Grateful living , that is the thing .
Well , think again .
Certainly not .
Learning patience , for instance .
How can we do it ?
Stop . Look . Go .
That &apos;s all .
But how often do we stop ?
You look . You open your eyes .
Thank you .
Here are two of them .
It looks a bit like this .
Now that &apos;s a really serious problem .
Silence is beautiful .
It &apos;s fun to get into designing with sound .
I do urge you to explore this .
First of all , listen consciously .
Protect your ears ? Yes , absolutely .
I wish you sound health .
Not like that .
They &apos;re not biologically compatible .
The first is feedstocks .
This is crazy .
And this gets us back to the mushrooms .
It &apos;s a waste product .
So , why mycelium ?
Biological yield is really important .
Thank you .
It gives you a sense of the trend .
I think of meditation .
And I &apos;m trying harder and harder .
Mom , I &apos;m really trying .
It is about action .
I said , &quot; Yes , Your Holiness .
I said , &quot; That &apos;s good . That &apos;s good .
And he says , &quot; But I have become skeptical .
She says the airports of the world .
The children were killed on the spot .
She also received the Peace Prize .
She is now running for president .
It &apos;s not a dirty word .
Thank you .
They can also see vacant property .
So it &apos;s a lot of vacancy .
Thank you .
This is Lake Baikal .
The lake is entirely frozen .
It &apos;s an extraordinary place .
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery .
Thank you .
They are supposed to be locked up .
Now , let me give you an example .
I &apos;ve had it . &quot;
At the beginning , it was a disaster .
&quot; Go away you maniac-psychopath .
Here &apos;s a piece of chocolate . &quot;
He &apos;s a 17-year-old .
That &apos;s what perspective is all about .
Now , let me give you an example of how it works .
It &apos;s that big .
Thank you .
I &apos;m supposed to scare you , because it &apos;s about fear , right ?
And this is what this adventure &apos;s really about .
This is crystallized DNA .
And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA , it looks like that .
And it &apos;s beginning to tell us a lot about evolution .
White Europeans were subject to the plague .
It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba .
So , this thing is 0.75 millimeters .
This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk .
Next line of code : make a stem .
Right ?
Okay ?
This is the way it should be seen .
Right ? But , you know , he &apos;s reasonably good looking , but ...
I won &apos;t go there .
You can look at this , right ?
And they look at the world a little differently .
They look at the same world and they say ...
It won &apos;t do anything for you .
Changes the nature of medicine . Changes the predictions of medicine .
And here &apos;s an interesting map .
So , this is what a new map of the world looks like .
You can break this out by states .
It &apos;s got nothing to do with inflation .
It &apos;s got nothing to do with privatization .
Here &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the world .
But thank you very much .
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice .
You would be sharper and more alert .
So , the technology is there .
It &apos;s called a &quot; neonurture device . &quot;
That &apos;s an interesting idea . &quot;
We should record it . &quot;
That &apos;s pretty cool . &quot;
Could you go the other way ?
And he said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s great .
Thank you very much .
But I would say no .
He can ask for additional information .
Thank you .
And these are base stations .
These are cellular mobile phones .
There &apos;s another problem .
That is efficiency .
And that creates a big problem .
Then there &apos;s ultraviolet light .
And guess what ?
Yes .
What do we need to do ?
But not only that .
And then what we have here is a little hole .
And the light goes through that hole .
There &apos;s a receiver .
It &apos;s illuminating the space .
You &apos;re critical .
You think , &quot; Ha , ha , ha .
But let me do this .
Once again .
Still don &apos;t believe ?
And the answer is yes .
So I &apos;ve mentioned to you the four challenges .
That &apos;s aside .
And then I &apos;ve mentioned the availability .
You have lights in an aircraft .
So it &apos;s everywhere in a day there is light .
And then there &apos;s security .
But I can give you a few examples .
And then we have these aircraft cabins .
Thank you .
And we want to learn other languages .
It &apos;s a very wuzzy line .
They kiss ; they embrace ; they hold hands .
So , this is a pretty grim picture .
How can we do it ?
Somebody said that yesterday .
Roots make a firm foundation .
Why ?
We do not believe in violence .
It &apos;s very encouraging .
Is it out there with the politicians ?
It &apos;s in our hands .
It &apos;s really up to us .
Thank you .
About 200 times usually .
This is it .
And the Marrow Miner , the way it works is shown here .
No robots required .
And played around with this a little bit .
Thanks .
I &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
Why consciousness ?
Now why is that curious ?
Here &apos;s how it went .
One : Consciousness does not exist .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
Well , I &apos;ll tell you the answer .
It &apos;s got a semantics .
I add two plus two to get four .
Thank you very much .
All right . Very significant mark .
Make a wish .
Wake up .
Joker : Whoa , whoa , whoa , oh !
I &apos;m performing for you .
Whoa .
MT : Bye bye .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
The boys call me faggot . &quot;
Or , &quot; He won &apos;t stop raping me .
And yeah , we &apos;re there .
Because this isn &apos;t what we do .
We do social change .
It &apos;s fast , it &apos;s pretty private .
It &apos;s real time .
That &apos;s great .
So think about a cop .
There &apos;s something in New York City .
You could inform legislation .
You could inform school policy .
What &apos;s going on in your school ? &quot;
Thank you .
Embrace the shake .
It did not happen overnight .
Thank you .
And then I get asked questions .
And the answer is skeletons .
A lot of it didn &apos;t pan out .
It &apos;s easy to bend .
The arrow shows you the long axis .
The cloth &apos;s cut on the bias .
But instead I saw this .
The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton .
I was really surprised at this .
And now I was looking at one .
He couldn &apos;t have been more wrong .
We &apos;ve got limits on our time .
Thank you .
Anyone ?
Who has experienced a lot of stress ?
Yeah . Me too .
Okay . Some bad news first .
Now we &apos;re going to all do this together .
It &apos;s going to be fun .
For me .
Go !
You &apos;re going too slow .
Stop . Stop , stop , stop .
That guy made a mistake .
We are going to have to start all over again .
That pounding heart is preparing you for action .
If you &apos;re breathing faster , it &apos;s no problem .
It enhances your empathy .
It &apos;s a stress hormone .
It &apos;s a natural anti-inflammatory .
Caring created resilience .
Thank you .
It &apos;s really , really tiring .
It &apos;s an interesting question .
I think that &apos;s true actually .
We didn &apos;t have a framework .
And I think that &apos;s probably right .
It &apos;s called chunking .
I think they &apos;re right .
And he used this following analogy .
That &apos;s pretty good .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m a storyteller .
It will dry up inside .
We all do .
I started writing fiction in English .
And that gap is very intimidating .
I asked him what he meant by that .
It comes from everywhere .
It was just a story .
One is interested in sweeping generalizations .
The other , in nuances .
One draws boundaries .
The other recognizes no frontiers .
Fiction is flowing water .
Like that , my fiction as well .
I &apos;m intrigued by this concept .
Thank you .
I &apos;m not connecting to them .
No ! You select .
Well I &apos;m trying to take a different approach .
Which made me go , &quot; Yippee ! &quot;
So , she &apos;s in the house .
These paintings took a long time to make .
He &apos;s never going to look at me .
And he never does .
Now , here &apos;s the story .
It &apos;s short .
Perhaps that was the intention .
I know , I could barely utter them .
Nothing need change . &quot;
George did not speak .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Naturally 7 : A full-band beatbox
So no ego problems .
And guess what ?
His intent is to be funny .
Why is this remotely controversial ?
Remove it from your household .
You &apos;ve got to love that idea .
And this cartoon hit the bull &apos;s eye .
And it didn &apos;t stop there .
Thank you .
Qatar is no exception to the region .
Her answer was quite the contrary .
And guess what ?
No , I don &apos;t think so .
Ask me .
Who are you playing ?
Play by yourself then .
Useless .
Thank you . Thank you !
It &apos;s important for two things .
We should not underestimate it .
This is what it looks like .
Rule one is you don &apos;t talk about / b / .
And I ended up on top .
They are still protesting .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Got a couple questions for you .
Don &apos;t tell .
CP : Yes and no .
CP : There are , certainly .
Love and peace were mentioned .
Okay , well .
That &apos;s very cool .
CP : That &apos;s a good question .
Good afternoon .
So here we go .
But cancers don &apos;t start out like this .
It invaded into his lungs .
That &apos;s impressive .
And extract from soybeans .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
Stop the treatment , gains the weight back .
Stop the treatment , it gains the weight back .
And there are many clinical trials .
Okay . Well , thank you so much .
Global famine was inevitable .
The acid rain was falling on the forests .
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
These are both real objects .
They &apos;ve come together .
No other animal does it .
You can have , as it were , asexual culture .
He doesn &apos;t need Adam .
And the answer is about half a second .
It was self-sufficiency .
How many other people ?
Tens ? Hundreds ? Thousands ?
And that &apos;s the way society works .
The queen does it all .
So when did this habit start ?
They were a highly intelligent species .
There &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
And that will have led to specialization .
Nobody , literally nobody .
I mean this quite seriously .
It &apos;s not the same with language .
It &apos;s completely irrelevant .
Thank you .
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy .
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .
But the noise didn &apos;t disappear .
Thanks .
It &apos;s bigger .
Suddenly it wasn &apos;t here at all .
What happened ?
And the aurochs was like the bison .
The extinctions still go on .
It went extinct in 2000 .
A little bit of film was shot .
Sorrow , anger , mourning .
Don &apos;t mourn . Organize .
We hired him full-time .
De-extinction falls in that category .
It was short-lived .
Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens .
There were just 254 left .
What do people think about it ?
Do you want extinct species back ?
What are they concerned about ?
We &apos;re also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve got a question .
Thank you so much for presenting . SB : Thank you .
Thank you .
So this didn &apos;t require any invention .
So — Thank you very much .
So this is happening in the Netherlands .
It &apos;s to replace competition by collaboration .
It &apos;s to transform any new product into a new market .
So it &apos;s a very simple condition .
Thank you very much .
So imagine yourself .
Thank you very much .
Now on to the detection algorithms .
Evan . Okay .
He just hangs out . He &apos;s relaxed .
So : one , two , three , go .
Okay .
Ah , good job !
That &apos;s really amazing .
This is &quot; disappear . &quot;
Okay . Let &apos;s try that .
Oh , my goodness . He &apos;s just too good .
Let &apos;s try that again .
EG : Losing concentration .
Good job . Good job .
Now blink right to go right .
Now blink left to turn back left .
Now smile to go straight .
I didn &apos;t have a phone number to call to say I was coming .
I was then 19 years old .
I said I wanted to meet .
Many years passed .
I &apos;d been working through my lot after all .
Who was I ?
I felt a pang of nerves .
He listened to me .
Many cried .
&quot; I was handsome , &quot; he said .
I had come for remorse .
&quot; Yes , I suffered . &quot;
We looked up at the wreckage .
&quot; Strange , &quot; I said .
I was baffled .
Yes , contrast .
And then I said , &quot; Goodbye . &quot;
Thank you .
Thanks a lot .
PM : Oh .
Pretty big .
and so how did you handle that ?
and &quot; will I really say something intelligent ? &quot;
Where are we ?
From some people .
Now there are 192 .
And it was really terrific .
And they really , really do .
40 billion of these things built .
Think about that .
And nature really does abhor a vacuum .
It doesn &apos;t radiate .
Mobile electronics .
Home electronics .
There are industrial applications .
You &apos;ve got a coil .
So , I &apos;ll plug that in .
It creates a magnetic field here .
And Nokia as well .
So , thank you very much .
I &apos;m a spectroscopist .
I never deal with images .
And I &apos;m not that far .
And I was saying , &quot; No , excuse me .
It &apos;s amazing .
How we get spectra ?
It &apos;s cool for me .
It can be an indication .
So this is a mystery .
It &apos;s very tough . It &apos;s very tough .
It &apos;s really difficult .
It will take about five years .
Thank you very much .
Bruce Feiler : The council of dads
I have cancer .
Early filer and late filer . &quot;
I crumbled .
Second , men only .
I was like , &quot; Cow tipping ?
I was like , &quot; Yes ? &quot;
Approach the cow . &quot;
What would you tell them ? &quot;
Instead , it was everybody running the other way .
Instead , it was all-hands-on-deck .
I was at a wall . &quot;
Don &apos;t give in to the wall .
We set out on crutches .
Take a walk with a turtle .
Behold the world in pause .
I want you to live . &quot;
In my case it &apos;s quarterly .
Thank you very much .
We &apos;ll look at ocean warming .
What frightens you ? &quot;
That changes our climate .
It &apos;s a scientific drilling vessel .
We had a waves up to 50 ft .
And we drilled in the Ross Sea .
That &apos;s the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there .
Here &apos;s the cartoon on the left there .
And here &apos;s what we found .
This was completely unexpected .
What caused it ?
And you know what ?
This is from Champion Island .
This coral is eight meters tall , right .
So we have a diamond drill .
Imagine that .
Each one of those is a year .
Here &apos;s a synthetic diagram .
It has many consequences .
Thank you very much .
Stew : &quot; Black Men Ski &quot;
Is this thing off ?
&quot; No . &quot;
Black men ski . Black men ski .
Same thing for processor speeds .
That &apos;s 8 a.m. shadows .
And that &apos;s all well and good .
Here are some selection planes .
And bring out this graph .
Kevin , can you help ?
All right .
We may need more than one .
Yeah , let &apos;s take that one .
And , as well , as of efficacy , agency .
That &apos;s our goal entirely .
So this is the inevitability about it .
And I understand what you &apos;re asking .
Thank you to you all .
Do you know what I wanted to be ?
Hey .
See this hand ?
No special needs schools .
No labels .
No limitations .
My ability and my potential .
And I believed I could do it .
I was 28 years old .
And I simply said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t see , and I need help . &quot;
And it &apos;s frightening , isn &apos;t it ?
Oh , for the love of God .
And there &apos;s nothing wrong with my sense of smell .
It &apos;s such a small thing , right ?
I had no idea who I was anymore .
God no , it was therapy .
To leave would be failure .
And he said , &quot; Do you love it ? &quot;
He thought I was mad enough anyway .
And that door closed .
And my chest ached .
And I went on a run that I know so well .
I always run it perfectly fine .
And I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Because who am I going to be ?
What am I going to be ? &quot;
I had lost my belief .
I was crumpled .
And it did happen this way .
And nobody can tell me no .
But I knew I would .
Six thousand people got to see because of that .
It was extraordinary .
That &apos;s what I wanted to do .
It just seemed that it was possible .
He said , &quot; Be you . &quot;
And so here I am .
This is me , all of me .
I simply needed vision and belief .
We all have to be included .
Thank you .
And I say , &quot; Empathy .
Start with empathy .
It all begins with empathy .
Here , I &apos;ll give you an example .
And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so .
This is what I saw .
And then I asked myself the question .
You can &apos;t expect that . &quot;
And just imagine what you would feel .
And you &apos;ve got to feel that .
Okay , so that &apos;s the warm up .
That &apos;s the warm up .
That &apos;s what you want .
You want a better life for yourself .
So here , let me help you .
Somebody else has a design for it .
The Americans , they &apos;re rich .
And back home , what do you see ?
Poverty , despair , struggle .
Look , you don &apos;t live in a wealthy country .
This is Iraq .
This is what you see .
You see people struggling to get by .
It &apos;s part of your life .
And you talk about it with your friends .
You read about it .
That &apos;s odd .
You can &apos;t help but think that .
You talk about it .
You say , &quot; How is that possible ? &quot;
But there &apos;s something else .
They &apos;re Christians .
Why ?
And they do wonderful things .
You read about it , you hear about it .
I mean , here &apos;s a guy who says that your God is a false God .
You pass it around . You pass his words around .
I mean this is serious . You &apos;re afraid .
Man , the Americans , they &apos;re just like , &quot; Ah , crusade .
Whatever . I don &apos;t know . &quot;
It &apos;s a holy war against Muslims .
If they won &apos;t submit , kill them .
That &apos;s what this is about .
This is frightening .
You feel frightened . Of course you feel frightened .
And the Americans : &quot; Ah , he &apos;s a knucklehead .
They laugh him off . You don &apos;t laugh him off .
Of course you &apos;re going to think this .
You &apos;ve got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp .
These Christians are nuts .
And go to the website .
It says &quot; U.S. Army &quot; right on it .
And you &apos;re reading this website .
You don &apos;t know that .
Isn &apos;t that interesting .
And it scares you , and it frightens you .
So these guys , you see them .
That &apos;s what they are to you .
So here .
Of course , you got it wrong .
You don &apos;t understand the Americans .
It &apos;s not a Christian invasion .
You have it wrong . You &apos;ve missed it .
But some of you do .
And this is a perspective .
Okay , so now , here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
Now here comes the radical experiment .
So we &apos;re all back home .
I feel her .
She &apos;s anybody to me .
So here &apos;s what I want you to do .
So I want you to go there .
What do you think about that scene ?
Okay , try this . Bring it back .
This is the scene here .
Can you feel the rage ?
Can you go there ?
It shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
You just -- oh , man .
Now , put yourself in their shoes .
Which one ?
Can you imagine that ?
Can you imagine saying that ?
Can you go there ?
You see , that &apos;s empathy .
It &apos;s also understanding .
And I say , because ... because .
You &apos;re allowed to hate these people .
Step inside of the tiny , little world of somebody else .
And then do it again and do it again and do it again .
Everything has changed .
Listen to other people , enlighten ourselves .
Thank you .
You know ?
It caused so much trouble for me .
I was so upset .
She &apos;s watching .
Name it , I &apos;m on it .
And it really informs my painting .
I &apos;m like , &quot; Oh , God . &quot; I went .
I said , &quot; Wow , &quot; again .
I was so inspired .
Education is great .
I like to think -- Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Shukran !
Good morning .
He started this with no money .
It is ourselves we are helping .
And the second year went up to 75 percent .
We looked at cost .
Thank you very much .
I do a radio show .
The radio show is called &quot; The Infinite Monkey Cage . &quot;
That &apos;s what I do .
That is gone .
This is a wonderful thing .
That is a wonderful idea .
But it &apos;s not gone .
That is a good thing .
We are all totally recyclable .
This is a wonderful thing .
And that is a wonderful thing there .
Love does not die because of that thing .
Pain doesn &apos;t go away either .
No , I just spit out a tooth .
I have a son . His name is Archie .
I &apos;m very lucky , because he &apos;s better than all the other children .
That is a wonderful thing .
I &apos;ve done some tests .
You house is in a terrible state .
You think , what should I do ?
Do nothing .
I &apos;m sitting on a train .
I &apos;m sitting on a chair .
That &apos;s not the point . &quot;
I can make my own purpose .
Thank you very much . Goodbye .
The 404 page is that .
And it serves you the 404 page .
Yes .
This is a global experience .
Joey !
Crowd : Whoa !
Renny Gleeson : You just ... no , he &apos;s not okay .
It turned into a 24-hour contest .
This is one that commiserates with you .
This is one that blames you .
This is one that I loved .
Thank you .
People aren &apos;t supposed to be there .
And I said , &quot; Great . &quot;
I thought I was very clever .
And I said , &quot; I want to do that . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , okay . &quot;
And I want to make a time machine . &quot;
And so this is very important .
Thank you .
And I &apos;m not in the present whatsoever .
It &apos;s daunting .
And I started to train .
It &apos;s a smiling face .
And I put together an expedition .
The navigation is difficult .
It &apos;s tricky .
And there &apos;s dehydration .
And there &apos;s hypothermia .
And there are sharks .
And there are all kinds of problems .
Are your shoulders ready ?
And they were . They were prepared .
Was the mind ready ?
And it &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
Is there an edge ?
And I knew I could do it .
First of all , you &apos;re going to hit obstacles .
You &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
Your body doesn &apos;t like the saltwater .
And I &apos;m yelling out , &quot; Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire !
Help me ! Somebody help me ! &quot;
And the next thing is paralysis .
Then come convulsions .
He &apos;s stung .
So that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
And I got back in .
And the dream was crushed .
And they do this wrapping .
&quot; Henry , what &apos;s your question ? &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s what you need .
I finished the swim like this .
I was swimming with this thing on .
That &apos;s how scared of the jellyfish I was .
So now what do I do ?
We &apos;ve all had a heartache .
Yeah .
Thank you .
But that ocean &apos;s still there .
This hope is still alive .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And so , what after that ?
Are you going to swim the Atlantic ?
No , that &apos;s the last swim .
But I &apos;m ready .
I said , &quot; Nope . I didn &apos;t know . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Live it large . Live it large .
And the first is pretty obvious .
OK , they just use Skype .
Scale is truly important .
And this year is worse .
It worked really well .
That &apos;s what it is .
Well , you can &apos;t see it .
This isn &apos;t a design , OK ?
And it &apos;s clearly just a model .
So it &apos;s sort of an electronic book .
Seven countries .
And yet we count .
It looks like a post office truck .
Period . None . Zero .
Are we providing the software ?
That is really done in the countries .
But we are certainly constructionists .
And that &apos;s the rollout .
I &apos;ve learned to be flexible .
Let me explain .
I think you can get change .
It didn &apos;t work .
But I found my place .
Consequently , we have .
Thank you .
And I think that &apos;s just a horrible thing .
And needless to say , I was right .
Bet on good people doing good things . &quot;
It &apos;s what we call , &quot; Invest , connect and celebrate . &quot;
Oh , thank you .
And I did a little calculation of this .
Here &apos;s my approach to it all .
Isn &apos;t there something shorter ?
The only question is , how short can you get ?
I actually like that one .
We could have been done by lunch here .
I mean ...
So I thought this was quite worthwhile .
So here are some of the results that I received . I think they &apos;re quite nice .
I would cut my costs by 90 percent .
They just had some general comment .
Here are some of my favorites .
So here I was .
It &apos;s a huge list .
Again , there were some misunderstandings .
Thank you very much .
And within a few months .
And I &apos;d like to show it .
And that may be just the beginning !
That &apos;s in the United States .
And we need that knowledge .
Amateurs can do it also .
Technology has moved forward .
Tough thing to do .
And the male ... We &apos;re going to see it again .
Disappears right into the background .
That &apos;s an amazing thing .
Here &apos;s some algae in the foreground ...
One , two , three .
Evolution has generated many species .
This is the wave , going from left to right . You can see this one .
Thank you .
It &apos;s 3.2 tons .
OK . Good .
And this is the water feeler .
It &apos;s a binary step counter .
Thank you .
It gets way better .
Thank you .
The answer turns out to be two percent .
It &apos;s actually about three percent .
Not quite ten percent .
Okay .
My favorite topic is shortcuts .
Do you agree ?
Good .
Hold the hand like this , palm up .
Right-molded you say , with iron ?
Over the heart , don &apos;t move the wrist .
Forward , don &apos;t move the wrist .
And forward . Yeah .
Now , the shortcut .
And then look at me .
Yeah !
One move . OK .
So , that was the warming up .
Now , I need an assistant .
And I will give my tribute to water .
And I think I &apos;ll take off this one .
memory system , right ?
Officially , I don &apos;t gamble but ...
So we have an agreement .
Which one shall have a good poker hand ?
Lennart Green : Three -- good .
I start with three queens .
And two tens .
Yeah . Thank you .
Ten , jack , queen , king , ace .
Yeah . So , good .
Such life . Right ?
So , please mix them .
Yes ?
Impressive . Thank you .
Right ? You agree .
OK .
Zoe : Stop .
And that &apos;s the stealing cards , which I did .
OK .
This is a little risky .
Come to -- no , no , no , no .
I &apos;m joking , yeah ?
Any style -- yeah , good .
I work direct with the right brain .
Not at the last card .
Zoe : Stop . LG : Yeah .
No , I &apos;m kidding .
Right ?
But now I &apos;m glad I remember it .
You don &apos;t see it , make no reaction ?
Yeah ?
But not too much .
Perfect .
Here -- shortcuts . I talk about shortcuts .
Yeah , great .
I think I have it .
Please name any card , anyone .
Jack of spades .
So -- oh , jack of spades .
So , jack of spades .
I think ...
It &apos;s the last .
Now , I do it quicker , better .
When I lift the heap , I peek .
You see , yeah , perfect .
LG : Diamonds , good . I start here .
Good , thank you .
The thing I did -- I peeked .
Another person .
Ten of diamonds .
Ten of diamonds .
Good .
Maybe you will cut ? Lift .
Excellent .
So , thank you . Another person , another card .
Five of clubs .
We do it again .
LG : Very good .
OK .
Excellent . I love that card .
and queen of hearts . Yes !
So , now a false count .
Zoe : The queen . LG : Queen , yes .
So , I use the queen , and here &apos;s five of clubs .
Eight , nine , 10 .
Yeah .
Now some hard stuff .
Now , to the satellites things .
Did the camera got it ?
No ?
They didn &apos;t ?
What happened ?
Do the cameras see the cards now ?
LG : But you see the hand .
Ah , good , good , good . But now .
So now , that was the reason , right ?
You see the cards ? Yes .
Yeah , good .
Perfect , excellent .
So -- I arrange the spades -- the clubs .
It doesn &apos;t matter to me .
Grab any one . Quick , quick , good .
And we switch this to the king .
Ace of diamonds .
So I find ...
king of spades .
Yeah ? OK .
Now , a little more difficult thing .
Another suit , please .
I like this guy , yeah .
I drop the cards and you -- which size ?
Which size ?
Say stop .
Ah , this is tough .
LG : OK , now .
I think we have it now . Yeah , good , good .
No ? Now ?
Yes , yes , OK .
I work with pattern .
Oh sorry , I dropped one .
I think I will do it ...
blindfolded .
Aargh !
Duct tape .
Go ahead . Yeah , good . I like the empathy .
Empathy .
But it was -- did you hear ?
Yeah , good . Yeah .
Right ? Good .
Satisfied ?
And it was OK . One more ?
The last .
OK .
All right .
I work with vibration .
So , what was the card ?
Diamonds . Ah , I memorized hearts .
Maybe I &apos;ll stand up . Half .
Ace of diamonds , yes ? Zoe : Yeah .
LG : Good . Good . Two -- -- thank you .
Two -- and it was two of spades , right ?
Three -- three of diamonds . Yes !
Four -- I like challenges , yes .
Yeah , good .
You &apos;re peeking .
LG : Pardon ?
Okay .
Try that .
LG : Yeah . Also listen .
OK , now .
This is maybe a little tough .
We will try .
Yes ? Good ?
Zoe : Five of diamonds , yeah .
LG : It &apos;s not here ? Zoe : It &apos;s not there .
LG : Oh .
So next card will be -- was it five ?
Yes ? Zoe : Yeah .
LG : Six -- six with the thumb .
Seven .
Right ?
Eight .
If -- and then nine , right ?
Yeah .
Nine ? Yeah ? Correct ?
No ? Yes ! Ah , good , good .
Yeah . Jack -- you &#91; unclear &#93; with Jack ?
LG : Yes ?
Misdirection .
Yeah ?
And then , king , after exactly five seconds .
Yeah . Five . Five seconds .
One , two , three , four -- mmm !
Check it .
Yes ?
King of diamonds . LG : Ah !
Good . Oh .
Touch me , feel -- ah , ah , you know !
Ladies and gentlemen , Lennart Green ! LG : Okay , thank you .
Okay .
It &apos;s what you dream about .
So here &apos;s the behind the scenes , a couple of little shots here .
And so I &apos;ll just show it one more time .
That doesn &apos;t move . &quot;
Precisely .
That &apos;s Hugo .
What do you think was the reason ? &quot;
So , yeah .
And the Pharaoh replies , &quot; Oh , no .
This time it &apos;s called the Facebook .
So exit the rock star .
Look at what &apos;s been achieved .
Look at the pictures these data sets print .
Wow . Wow .
Give it up for that .
Halved . Halved .
This is everything .
Can &apos;t be true , can it ?
That &apos;s amazing .
There are all kinds of benefits to this .
How about that ?
Well , the opportunity is real , but so is the jeopardy .
Look at this graph .
And the next one is really beautiful .
It &apos;s called momentum .
This is exciting stuff .
It &apos;s transformational .
Wael is right .
Thank you .
Thank you so much .
It seems like it &apos;s perfectly reasonable to ask that .
So here &apos;s some examples .
What is that about ?
Why is that ?
Why is that happening ?
That &apos;s what happens at the office .
I was at work .
I just did tasks .
How about seven hours ?
Six ? Five ? Four ?
That &apos;s not really what I mean .
That doesn &apos;t really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me .
And I &apos;m one of these managers .
I understand . I know how this goes .
But oftentimes they &apos;ll cite distractions .
So let &apos;s go through a couple of those .
That &apos;s kind of ridiculous . It &apos;s a total decoy .
That &apos;s kind of bad .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
What if they &apos;re doing important work ?
So just the afternoon , one Thursday .
Just silence , that &apos;s it .
It &apos;s better than a computer .
Just don &apos;t have it .
So thanks for listening .
Deborah Gordon : The emergent genius of ant colonies
This is a three-year-old colony .
They somehow get into this reserve .
The patrollers become foragers .
They smell with their antennae .
The pattern itself is the message .
So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance .
But it works pretty well .
Thank you .
And I thought , &quot; Great .
It &apos;s plastic pollution .
What is the reality of that ?
Thank you .
Let &apos;s talk about manias .
Manias can be good .
Manias can be alarming .
A mania for learning English .
Teacher : ... change my life !
Two billion of them .
Teacher : Perfect ! Students : Perfect !
T : Perfect ! S : Perfect !
Your native language is your life .
Mathematics is the language of science .
Music is the language of emotions .
Thank you very much .
I said , &quot; Where are the Qataris ? &quot;
&quot; They know . &quot;
I &apos;m working already . &quot;
I &apos;m going to be all right . &quot;
I need to rest . &quot;
Never &quot; Hi , Jack . &quot;
Thank you , TED .
She says , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s beautiful .
Wha -- what do you do ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know , you know ?
Not a joke .
Now , this is the normal way it &apos;s done .
Now , I &apos;m also very interested in cooking .
You would not believe it !
So , I like to support people that are risking their lives .
I said , &quot; Oh , yeah , yeah -- absolutely . &quot;
Is that you ? &quot;
So , I do a lot of work on dinosaurs .
And I resemble that remark .
You know , skiers pray for snow ?
It &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
It &apos;s about the size of a banana .
It has a big serration on the edge .
You know .
It &apos;s true .
They don &apos;t have them .
That &apos;s kind of what it &apos;s like .
That &apos;s it , thank you .
Okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
Hahahaha .
AK : Haa haa haaa .
BJ : Okay so .
I really thought they were so beneath me .
So we began with a test .
So we made a model .
It had to be shipped to London .
Here is the plan .
Joey boy , you there ?
Joey .
Joey .
Joey , come here .
No , no , I haven &apos;t got it .
He &apos;s got it ; it &apos;s in his pocket .
BJ : Joey .
Move around . Come on .
He &apos;s working the leg .
Horses are so unpredictable .
The hind legs have got the same action .
You see the skeletal structure of it .
And plant .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Go and study it . &quot;
Now -- but that &apos;s not the whole story .
I &apos;d -- there &apos;s one story I &apos;d just like to mention .
But I felt something .
And it was a physiological response .
Remember that ?
I remember it clearly .
I thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
And so I did some experiments .
And would you do me a favor ?
I get a sense of anticipation &quot; ?
Now I &apos;m not a neuroscientist .
But it might be .
They arrive first .
So how do we make that actually work ?
It &apos;s a plastic bag .
Look at that . What are you feeling about it ?
Is it beautiful ? Is it exciting ?
Look at that picture .
Is it beautiful now ?
Stop . Stop . How do you feel ?
Where are you feeling this ?
I &apos;m feeling it here . I feel it here .
But what are you doing ?
I watch what people do .
I watch faces .
I watch reactions .
It &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;
That &apos;s not the expression of joy .
There &apos;s something else in that .
There &apos;s something weird happening .
It isn &apos;t just about nice .
And that &apos;s packed in there as well .
Well it obviously isn &apos;t .
So it wasn &apos;t about symmetry .
But they &apos;re both different .
I &apos;m not getting it off the eyebrow .
And the earhole isn &apos;t doing it to me at all .
Ahhhh .
It &apos;s masses and masses of layers .
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension .
It &apos;s something much bigger .
So that &apos;s getting me excited .
And I feel that here .
Titanium lacquer on this .
I &apos;m really getting into this now .
So it disappears .
Why would you do that ?
We have to deal with it .
And so look at her .
I &apos;ve had to make a bit of a compromise there .
No one &apos;s noticed , have they yet ?
Did you see what I did ?
Pretty ? Yes .
Beautiful ? Maybe lesser .
So that &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
Another millimeter ?
And only a few people can do it .
And a focus group cannot do it .
So all hail to that .
So we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
Are you ready ? Okay .
It &apos;s not .
So is that wrong ?
But you &apos;re a slave of that first flash .
It wins or loses at that point .
Some of you , I &apos;m sure , will be familiar with this .
Yeah ?
It &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
Look at that . Do you want to see it again ?
You didn &apos;t maybe know it .
But how do you feel about it ?
Form follows function ?
Only sometimes . Only sometimes .
Form is function . Form is function .
Thank you very much .
Wassup .
Thank you very much , TEDx .
Look at this , Mom ! I made it !
India .
China .
Germany .
Party , party , yeah .
TEDx .
All right boys , take it away .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Now I did have an advantage .
So I read slowly .
Paradise is quite the opposite .
It &apos;s not virginity ; it &apos;s fecundity .
It &apos;s plenty .
It &apos;s gardens watered by running streams .
Thank you .
He was not a political prisoner .
And the third is commitment .
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
A judge would let her out . &quot;
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot;
Because it sounds big .
Never going to happen . &quot;
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
What is a bird ?
This is a bird .
That was a nice thing to get .
That was one sentence .
This is what I presented to the White House .
Which part of this don &apos;t you like ?
They become building steel .
That &apos;s the Pacific Gyre .
Perhaps that &apos;s away .
Does it work ? Do I like it ?
&quot; And where does it go ? &quot;
&quot; Customers . &quot;
There is no finish line .
This is obviously a color photograph .
They showed up in five days .
This is the site .
This is their plan .
We lay out the building areas .
So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants .
&quot; Give me liberty or give me death . &quot;
Who could blame them ?
This schism has only grown wider .
Of course they would .
I want to be able to do what China &apos;s doing .
It &apos;s the refrigerators .
It put a man on the moon .
That &apos;s a picture of me .
Awww .
Thank you very much .
Sorry , TED .
Awwww .
I &apos;ll just say , July .
Zzzzzzip for safety .
Water wings -- an inch of water .
He &apos;s interested in playing football .
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle .
Let &apos;s take a look .
So a car accident .
So look to the right-hand side of the screen .
What would you say ?
How many Gs ?
Close .
Seventy-two .
Let me tell you what I &apos;ve come up with .
If only .
She &apos;s totally not kidding . &quot;
The first : study up .
The second thing is : speak up .
How old it is ?
Wear a helmet .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And I sort of really was dumbstruck .
This is called the registry of standard biological parts .
The feature side is -- you know , people will say , &#91; unclear &#93; down around about 65 nanometers now .
On the right , that &apos;s a radiolara .
These are little mechanical computers .
This is three minutes of UV light .
It &apos;s about a centimeter on the side .
It just -- you don &apos;t want to do that .
That takes about two seconds to make .
And so I regard that as done .
Do they have T.B. ? Do they have AIDS ?
Do they have a common cold ?
And we &apos;ll start by posing a little problem .
And , of course the answer is , &quot; You don &apos;t . &quot;
There &apos;s the chip .
It works really , really well .
Thank you very much .
And there &apos;s something else .
Well , things have changed .
First of all , the rules have changed .
This is the landscape of one medicine .
And we did .
That can be generic manufacturers .
They were forced to do so .
And this is no longer fantasy .
This has never been done before .
This has never been seen before .
Thank you .
So can we have the lights back on please ? Thank you .
Thank you .
It all begins with enjoyment .
We are running late .
And she &apos;s out there .
But actually , just the opposite is happening .
No small thing .
Thank you .
What is the significance ?
How much learning can you do ?
So , that &apos;s one aspect .
It &apos;s a very , very strong force .
It &apos;s the increased order .
We actually don &apos;t know .
That &apos;s where technology is going .
I think that really leads nowhere .
You try it out .
And we are aware of the price .
Good morning everybody .
We are They Might Be Giants .
This is a brand new song .
Thank you very much .
Probably somewhere around 1,500 .
It &apos;s hard to know .
So thank you .
All right .
Marty Beller on the drums over there .
This song is called &quot; Fingertips . &quot;
Hello there .
You &apos;re live .
Hello . Who &apos;s there , please ?
Am I on the air ?
Hi there .
This is Eleanor Roosevelt .
Hello , Eleanor , please ...
I want to talk to ...
Please turn off your radio , Eleanor .
I wanna talk to Randi .
I &apos;ve got a question for Randi .
What &apos;s your question , please ?
I want my million dollars .
No , I don &apos;t have a badge .
This song is called &quot; The Alphabet ...
Of Nations ! &quot;
Thank you all .
We cannot predict the future .
These people have different needs .
We want to be treated as individuals .
This will be very different in the future .
It follows the design of bone .
See you in the future . Thank you .
And my season is November .
And I said , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s interesting . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Thank you for doing Movember . &quot;
Thank you .
Why ?
So the key here is empathy .
I thank you for your attention .
So now , just , this is an abrupt transition here .
Pause for about 10 seconds .
Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage . &quot;
My history is Irish .
Ann Cooper : What &apos;s wrong with school lunches
That &apos;s my premise .
We can &apos;t keep doing that .
You know , it doesn &apos;t work .
And the result of it is , we have diseases .
And that has to change , you know .
What &apos;s going to happen ?
They &apos;re not going to be smart .
We have recycling in all of our schools .
We really need to change it .
It &apos;s sort of this &quot; duh &quot; thing .
That is not lunchtime .
That number probably needs to double .
200 billion .
We can all make a difference .
Thank you .
So I came up with the following setup .
Ah , some of you have . Excellent .
It &apos;s a liquid that is completely black .
It &apos;s got an oily consistency .
Let me demonstrate this over here .
It &apos;s got nothing in it .
Add some more .
And now , let &apos;s set that on fire .
So that &apos;s all that happens .
Thank you .
What &apos;s the idea behind it ?
Is it just a waste of whiskey ?
Thank you very much .
And our minds have altered , too .
And the fellow said , &quot; Absolutely nothing .
And he said , &quot; Of course not .
One &apos;s a fish .
The other is a bird . &quot;
Are there camels in Hamburg ? &quot;
How can we address them ? &quot;
And let me give you a few illustrations .
And so forth .
What about employment ?
Or take a farmer today .
I &apos;m primarily a moral philosopher .
How would you feel about that ?
Would you deserve to be killed ?
What are dogs like ?
They would say wolves .
They could say a semicircle .
As if they were a reptile .
Now , let me talk about the first one first .
There &apos;s 10 tickets in this lottery .
You &apos;re on your way to the theater .
Most people answer , no .
What the hell difference should it make ?
And I &apos;m going to show you one or two of them .
Let me just give you an example .
Most people say they would .
What do we find now ?
Thank you .
That was remarkable .
Talk more about it .
What is it ?
That &apos;s not my point at all .
There are no guns going off .
There &apos;s no question .
People died ; so be it .
Is that what happened ?
Last question .
AdG : In persuading them .
Ah , for you in persuading them .
But these are tricks around the margins .
They were fantastic .
He loved intellectual battle .
He had a gargantuan ego .
Somehow he did .
He loved to win .
Feynman loved this story .
Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness .
And they were full of all kinds of jargon .
And what did we talk about ?
They were so happy .
Dick and I had a certain , a little bit of a rapport .
I don &apos;t think he was right .
But he was convinced of this .
And he was curious .
The man was incredibly curious .
And one day we were walking . We were in France .
We were up in the mountains , 1976 .
We were up in the mountains , and Feynman said to me , he said , &quot; Leonardo . &quot;
And Feynman &apos;s eyes just opened up .
He wanted to go out and do an experiment .
So , well he did .
He went out and did an experiment .
There was a theory .
He had an idea , a very clear idea .
It was the technique of Feynman diagrams .
The experiments that were going on were very simple .
They &apos;re difficult integrals .
People were trying to do them .
Feynman said , &quot; Forget all of that .
The electron hits it suddenly .
What do you see ?
Thank you .
There &apos;s no suggestion of a relationship there .
They &apos;re all weighted equally .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily close correlation .
Everything goes into it .
Highly significant relationship .
Here , for instance , is trust .
Same thing is going on .
We &apos;re not just talking about a fluke .
This is mental illness .
This is violence .
This is the proportion of the population in prison .
Again , quite big differences .
This is social mobility .
Japan is rather different though .
It has lower taxes .
It has a smaller welfare state .
This is just one example .
It &apos;s infant mortality .
Otherwise that would introduce bias .
What about other countries ?
What about causality ?
We spend a good bit of time .
Thank you .
Animals are not just raw materials .
It is beautiful , and it has long been a part of our history .
Now how do we do it ?
It &apos;s natural connective tissue .
What could the future of animal products look like ?
Rather , it could be much more like this .
It is where cell culture takes place .
It &apos;s environmentally responsible , efficient and humane .
It allows us to be creative .
Thank you .
But this is really just the beginning .
So , take a look .
But this piece is due out in May .
Now , the solution turned out to be simple .
And what it was was oral rehydration salts .
Many of you have probably used this .
Remarkable impact on mortality .
Massive solution to the problem .
What &apos;s going on here ?
That &apos;s actually not true .
Maybe there &apos;s a biological answer .
OK , the American population .
It &apos;s not just medicine .
This is the last mile .
Alright , what &apos;s the problem ?
The mind is more complex .
Think about what that means for a second .
How is that possible ?
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s stupid .
Just doesn &apos;t make sense .
It &apos;s more complex than that .
The bat costs a dollar more than the ball .
So , somebody out there says , &quot; Five . &quot;
A lot of you said , &quot; Ten . &quot;
this is easy , $ 1.10 .
Most of you look smart .
I know algebra can be complicated .
That &apos;s all it is . OK ?
Ready ? Black .
Ready ? Go .
Audience : Red . Green .
Yellow . Blue . Red .
What is all this telling us ?
The second task is fuel efficiency . Okay ?
Here &apos;s another puzzle for all of you .
See , you have a mental model .
Maybe it &apos;s the diarrhea .
Let &apos;s go back to diabetes .
It &apos;s also painful .
The needle is particularly sharp .
You just gotta carry this thing around .
It &apos;s much easier to use , much less painful .
Here &apos;s another example of this .
This is about energy efficiency .
All right . Thank you very much .
So , there is a little bit of slippage there .
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
Adam Ostrow : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
AO : Who is this ?
Thank you very much .
It never left my brain .
What is the cost of that battery ?
You have the crude oil .
But the crude oil is replaced with a battery .
And so it &apos;s sort of a mini well .
You , today , buy gasoline miles .
That is an 80 cent gallon .
We sent letters to all the car companies .
It &apos;s called the other car .
That won &apos;t do much difference .
We have all these regions .
We have to make it immediately .
Thank you all very much .
And I know what you &apos;re thinking .
Wow ! Some of you watched it .
That &apos;s great . That &apos;s great .
This is Donna .
This is Donna eating ice cream .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk to you about today .
No pun intended .
And I just saw the power of the image .
And it was incredible .
I &apos;ve got to go see what this is all about .
I will pay for their study .
And they will stay there .
And it was revolting .
It was absolutely revolting .
It made me sick to my stomach .
That &apos;s bad . &quot;
And it didn &apos;t affect me as much .
It makes me hate war .
It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film .
May God forgive you .
If you were not Abu Azzam &apos;s daughter ...
Will we win that way ?
And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on ?
Be careful !
We &apos;re looking for three girls .
Are you sure she is dead ? &quot;
They said yes .
I am the headmaster for all parts .
Death unto apartheid ! &quot;
Yes . Yes !
Freedom !
And that &apos;s an amazing thing .
There &apos;s Witness , that you heard from earlier .
Comedies , documentaries , shorts .
And we called that landmass Pangea .
And that &apos;s my wish .
And now , 2012 .
Let me give you an example .
You know , it &apos;s very interesting .
Thank you very much .
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas .
It &apos;s based on wonder .
It &apos;s something very personal .
I have never been a fan of the neutral .
I think expression .
That &apos;s what expression is .
So again , radical versus conservative .
And of course , we are all about the struggle of emotions .
I think that is the progress of cities .
Hand versus the computer .
And yet , our lives are complex .
Our emotions are complex .
Our intellectual desires are complex .
The political is not an enemy of architecture .
It &apos;s not only the giving of answers .
It &apos;s also , just like life , the asking of questions .
Therefore it is important that it be real .
It &apos;s not something that comes to us from books and theories .
Unexpected versus habitual .
It &apos;s a self-induced poison .
So the unexpected is always unexpected .
So again , the unexpected which is also the raw .
So that is indeed what is memory .
There would be nowhere to turn .
And these are our dreams .
And of course risk . I think architecture should be risky .
It &apos;s about space . It &apos;s not about fashion .
It &apos;s not about decoration .
And I think that is really the nature of architecture .
Now I am a believer in democracy .
There are emotions of the victims .
I think architecture is about consensus .
And that is where I end .
This is America . This is liberty .
Thank you , and godspeed .
Transportation walls came tumbling down .
Trade has increased .
Here is just a little bit of data .
Growth was negative .
Now why .
The reason for this is incentives .
That &apos;s one reason .
Globalize trade .
How else can we create new ideas ?
Well , more idea creators .
And for that I am very grateful .
That is a good thing .
India is coming on line .
Africa is coming on line .
Now think what this means .
That &apos;s not that far .
We won &apos;t make it .
What about a great depression ?
So what actually happened ?
Spread the ideas . Spread the light .
Thank you .
The product was that airplane .
Ze fuselage , ze empanage , ze nessal .
It did mine .
I wanted to build airplanes .
You couldn &apos;t transfer those to the model itself .
You had to learn about aeronautics .
You should be in the art department . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
And it exists .
And I quit .
So I chose furniture .
But not office chairs .
I conceived the kind of airplane .
I basically engineered it .
I built it .
And I flew it .
There are drawbacks to this .
They begin to fall off the end of your chart .
They will sit in them forever .
She said , &quot; But it &apos;s too high . &quot;
He came over and looked at it .
And he showed her the lever .
So I spent a long time .
No arms at all .
Just your own .
There &apos;s two of them , one on either side .
And that &apos;s a lot of load .
And breathability is good .
So here we are .
You cant hit your elbow on bottom .
I love video games .
I &apos;m also slightly in awe of them .
It gives you great powers .
It &apos;s a very great pleasure to fly around .
Simple game quest .
I &apos;ve got to keep opening boxes .
Let &apos;s think about probability .
It keeps people engaged .
That would be very boring .
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number .
There &apos;s 100 percent up here .
Third , you reward effort .
Fourth , feedback .
And fifth , the element of uncertainty .
There are real concerns there .
Let &apos;s start with business .
We can use calculated randomness .
Thank you very much .
Number two : hesitation is bad .
Rule number three : have a plan .
You have to plan ahead to get to the top .
You &apos;ve got to keep going .
Rule number five : know how to rest .
And of course there is rule number nine .
So don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
Thank you very much .
You still with me ?
I called her up .
&quot; Hello , how &apos;re you doing , baby ? &quot;
&quot; Hey , ma , I got to talk to you . &quot;
&quot; Ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not sure . &quot;
Then my pop got on there .
He &apos;s from Florida .
&quot; Papi , help . &quot;
&quot; After what I just told you ? &quot;
Great story is the art of letting go .
So I &apos;m going to tell you a little story .
I &apos;m telling you this one .
It &apos;s called , &quot; You &apos;re Going to Miss Me . &quot;
I called my mom .
It was a Saturday morning .
It &apos;s delicious . It &apos;s savory .
That kind of food , yeah .
I got an errand to run . &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t speak English ? &quot;
&quot; No . &quot;
There &apos;s a historical marker .
Anybody ? All right .
Rockports -- they &apos;re for this .
That &apos;s why they call them that .
I show up . She &apos;s in the carport .
Of course , they have a carport .
The kind with the corrugated roof , you know .
&quot; I got a surprise for you , baby ! &quot;
&quot; We taking your car ? &quot;
&quot; Not we , I. &quot;
Blithering fucking idiots .
I said , &quot; Is that thing real ? &quot;
&quot; I think so . &quot;
&quot; Can you even see ? &quot;
&quot; I guess I must . &quot;
&quot; Oh , Jesus . &quot;
&quot; You coming ? You no coming ? &quot;
&quot; Are you kidding me ? &quot;
&quot; How are you doing it ? &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s got to sleep sometime . &quot;
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front .
And I said , &quot; Ma , would you slow down ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Ma , pick a lane ! &quot;
&quot; They give you seven lanes , they expect you to use them . &quot;
&quot; No , no , what you talking about ? &quot;
&quot; Four or five days . &quot;
&quot; Yeah . And you haven &apos;t been stopped ? &quot;
&quot; I did not get a ticket . &quot;
&quot; You weren &apos;t there , don &apos;t start . &quot;
&quot; Come on . You got a ticket ? &quot;
&quot; Ma , are you still doing that ? &quot;
&quot; If it works , it works , baby .
&quot; Yeah ? What ?
You should be terrified .
Audience : Yes .
&quot; You mean , like , in the car ? &quot;
It &apos;s Saturday . It &apos;s the holidays . &quot;
But you know .
&quot; It will upset you . &quot;
&quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God ! &quot;
Olivia ? Huh ? Huh ?
Correct the other direction now , it &apos;s OK .
We &apos;re doing great . We &apos;re doing fine .
Well , I stood up to her .
This is new and fast , just so you -- are you still with us ?
We &apos;ll wait for the slow ones . OK .
A brevity , brevity of everything with this child .
You know , she eats small portions .
She wields great power .
Bless you , Dr. Watson .
She says , &quot; Ma , you got to look ! &quot;
&quot; No , mama , you got to look . &quot;
I got to look . You got to look .
Don &apos;t you want to look ?
There she is .
Ready ? Brace yourselves . Here it comes .
Oh , Jesus . Oh , Jesus .
I finally come -- and now , it &apos;s the South .
I don &apos;t know what part of the country you live in .
I think we all secretly love stories .
We want to curl up and say , &quot; Tell it to me , tell it to me .
Come on , honey , tell it to me . &quot;
Bets are placed .
&quot; I &apos;m with the little lady . Damn ! &quot;
She is , after all , Cuban .
Like you &apos;ve never thought that in your life ? Right ? Yeah .
I pull in . I put the car in park .
&quot; I &apos;m not going anywhere . &quot;
She &apos;s hugging the purse .
&quot; Ma , have you no shame ?
Secret of the trade .
Some , they &apos;re just right there , right there . Put them right there .
She says this to me .
Intrepid soul .
She jumped out of that car . &quot;
It &apos;s a beautiful hierarchy , and it works .
It &apos;s a half-whisper , &quot; God , I miss her . &quot;
&quot; What , ma ? &quot;
So that was the idea .
Okay , so that &apos;s the first case of matricide .
But it doesn &apos;t stop there .
But more likely is this .
And they all seemed to be OK .
So that &apos;s my talk .
We have it backwards . Right ?
But that &apos;s completely wrong .
Why did you do it ? &quot;
There are inherent benefits to this .
Bad system of survival .
So I said something .
And this is exactly what she said to me .
We would never do it .
It &apos;s the complete opposite .
None at all .
And Bob refused .
This is what a leader is .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And that &apos;s how you make a movement .
But let &apos;s recap some lessons from this .
Thanks .
How do we know this ?
We can build on their wisdom .
The other one says , &quot; Fine . Looks good to me .
We &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Now the job is done .
And he said to me , &quot; Oh no .
They &apos;re far closer together than that . &quot;
They slow the flow of technologies .
And they even slow the flow of genes .
And they impose a barrier to cooperation .
Thank you .
MR : Thank you very much indeed .
And this particular one is about cigarette addiction .
And this is what the next piece is about .
A strange phenomenon .
Why is that ?
The virus is defeated .
Now , what does this mean ?
So what we &apos;ve got is a situation .
Let me give you another example .
So I want you to think back a few months ago .
Almost nothing has changed .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
So , the science is changing .
SB : Thank you .
This is an ocean planet .
Fish do not sit in seats .
They don &apos;t fall over . They don &apos;t fall .
OK , this is good stuff .
She has twice the wingspan that I do .
There I &apos;m coming ; she sees me .
Now , there she goes , right overhead .
This is a wide-angle camera .
She wanted to dance .
Thank you .
And we are silent about them .
We think it is shortcut .
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up .
I can &apos;t hear from my right ear .
And there is a long pause .
There it ends .
That &apos;s my biggest challenge .
They need your empathy .
Can you just encompass these people too ?
Thank you .
Look at the skyline of Shanghai .
This is the Pudong area .
Here &apos;s the key question .
This is a key issue .
And Country 2 is possibly India . &quot;
That &apos;s not too good .
And Country 2 is China .
Both countries are in Asia .
And which one is a democracy ? &quot;
One reason is the East Asian Model .
Korea succeeded , North Korea didn &apos;t .
Burma didn &apos;t succeed .
The Philippines didn &apos;t succeed .
So that &apos;s when China was mad .
The whole country went mad .
In China , it &apos;s all women .
What about the political system ?
Thank you very much .
So let &apos;s first talk about focused ultrasound .
It is made out of silicon .
It is transparent , made just for you .
It &apos;s just a lesion formed inside .
They were missing the vision .
So the first one is in the brain .
So I &apos;d like you to meet John .
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years .
And medication didn &apos;t help him anymore .
And this is his handwriting .
And the objective of that ?
So he presses &quot; sonicate , &quot; and this is what happens .
And it does this burst of energy .
It elevates the temperature .
This doesn &apos;t cause any damage .
This is an immediate relief .
Thank you .
And this is a quote from John after he wrote it .
He said , &quot; Miraculous . &quot;
And you wonder why .
They are dependent on others .
Okay , so you can see here the spot .
There &apos;s no damage outside .
He suffers from no neurodeficit .
He had to forgo all the farm activities .
And his wife actually took him .
He rides his tractor .
And he has been very happy .
And doing that in the U.S.
is very painful .
And this will take time .
This will take two years .
Women suffer from that disease .
This is Frances .
This is a big fibroid .
We are drowning in news .
Or this ?
Or this ?
Really ?
Okay , that was kind of cool .
What about global politics ?
Now I haven &apos;t got anything against efficiency .
How clever would we have to be ?
So it looks a little bit like this .
That &apos;s called the circular flow of the economy .
It looks harmless enough .
And in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
Is this really how people are ?
&quot; Here they are , the giraffes . &quot;
What is the objective ?
&quot; What is the objective of the consumer ? &quot;
So who are we ?
Who are these people ?
It is about opening up .
And we &apos;re going to do it .
It has to be about transition .
It &apos;s not about overthrowing capitalism .
It &apos;s not about trying to change human nature .
Thank you very much .
Now I &apos;m going to give you a story .
We were four girls and no boys .
Children don &apos;t choose a school .
I &apos;m the only one who &apos;s left in India .
So we are four of us in four corners of the world .
You either go up , or you come down . &quot;
You can &apos;t do a thing about it .
You &apos;ve got to just respond to the situation .
Why I said this , is the background .
So I &apos;m going to move on .
Let &apos;s lock her up . &quot;
Here I got a prison assignment .
Obviously , it was .
I said , &quot; Do you pray ? &quot;
And they didn &apos;t say anything .
Government had no budget .
This was initiated in Delhi prison .
These are hundreds of classes .
It was the beginning of a change .
Books came from donated schoolbooks .
Stationery was donated .
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control .
This was a magic box .
This was a sensitive box .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
We had basically three requirements .
And we wanted it to be easy to use .
But does it work ?
Some 74 percent of people received the data .
And 73 percent of them shared it .
Technology is transformational .
You can find out about the latest security incident .
You can find out about places of worship .
You can find out about the health centers .
Thank you very much .
So that &apos;s theory , that &apos;s great .
So this is great . It simplifies things .
I wouldn &apos;t know .
SG : So that &apos;s exactly right .
Thank you .
Alison Jackson : An unusual glimpse at celebrity
Momentum was being built .
Was she pregnant when she died ?
Of course , the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...
watch her horses . .
Well , here is the image .
They thought it was real .
And me as the Queen .
Then I made a book .
This image I &apos;ve decided to show having a reservation about it .
Thank you .
He said they were wrong .
From nothing to thing .
It was really , you know , sort of a shitty time .
I thank you .
What &apos;s the point of teaching people math ?
What is math ?
That &apos;s stage two .
Now here &apos;s the crazy thing right now .
It &apos;s the chore .
That &apos;s an amazing amount of human endeavor .
For example : mental arithmetic .
It &apos;s a major subject .
Basics of what ?
I don &apos;t think so .
Why do you think that was ? &quot;
I don &apos;t think so .
This is just nuts .
All backwards .
They &apos;ve got hair all over them .
I don &apos;t think so -- quite the opposite .
It &apos;s called programming .
Why is this ?
And very , very simple .
Very simple example .
How many years of protection do I need ?
Thanks .
It remembers that it &apos;s cancer .
I have a small lab .
They were changing shape .
And this was , unfortunately , successful .
So what next ?
It &apos;s not orally available .
It &apos;s funded by foundations .
What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot;
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
My son is 23 .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
Boy : How about this ?
Same as the other side .
Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
I don &apos;t know .
AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
AG : Now this is his next idea .
Not working either .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
So when you put four .
AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
This is the land .
It has many contrasts .
It is rough and it is flat .
In places it is cold .
In some it is hot .
Here is something of the way they live .
So that was just a little snip .
I &apos;m no exception .
And Charles just checking it out there .
So now we &apos;re going to go through that door of furniture .
It &apos;s not enough to create one .
This is a relatively famous chair .
It worked better : &quot; H &quot; base , much more practical .
This is something called a splint .
And they &apos;d been working on furniture before .
Now look at that plastic chair .
They focused on the need .
It &apos;s kind of a brutal quote .
I want to give you one example .
Modeling , they tried modeling all the time . They were always modeling things .
Design was not something other .
It was part of the business of life in general .
It was part of the quality of life .
And here is some family pictures .
So we &apos;re going to watch another film .
This is a film , the one called Toys .
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys .
And now I &apos;m going to test you .
So can you read it ?
Lucia angel , okay , eye .
Audience : Saw many trains .
Dawn , very good .
Also rode on one . I ...
Citizen Kane , rose -- Audience : Rosebud .
It &apos;s sort of an alternative universe .
It &apos;s kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape .
And you try something out .
But here is what &apos;s really great .
Now we &apos;re going to do some movies . &quot;
So this is Charles &apos; voice .
And then things get to be a little questionable .
And there is solid silver thalis .
But you can go beyond that .
And I also want to share this one .
That &apos;s what we all need to do .
I really thank you for your time .
And electric fields are not magnetism .
What electric fields are are a field of forces .
They begin to be attracted towards Earth .
And we can observe this .
The one within the circle manages .
We divided the patients into two groups .
They had no pain , suffered none of the infections .
He received the standard treatments .
He received surgery .
He received high dose radiation to the head .
And he received first-line chemotherapy .
And a year after that treatment , his tumor grew back with a vengeance .
He entered our trial .
There &apos;s none of the tiredness .
There &apos;s no sensation .
It &apos;s still there .
Her cancer continued to grow .
She is managing her farm .
It &apos;s only the beginning .
Thank you .
Yves Rossy : Fly with the Jetman
And that &apos;s quite unique .
There is Yves Rossy .
He is down . Is he flying ?
He &apos;s starting to make his climb .
He &apos;s out over the channel .
There is Yves Rossy .
There is no turning back now .
Commentator : There he is .
Yves Rossy has landed in England .
And his equipment as well .
Yves , welcome . It is quite amazing .
What is it &#91; like &#93; to be up there ?
Yves Rossy : It &apos;s fun . It &apos;s fun .
I don &apos;t have feathers .
You take a position like that .
You have no machine around you .
You are just in the element .
It &apos;s very short and only in one direction .
And it &apos;s really like the kid playing the airplane .
I want to go down like that .
And up I climb , I turn .
It &apos;s really pure flying .
It &apos;s not steering , it &apos;s flight .
So you have to adapt .
So Breitling &apos;s four engines .
YR : Yeah , two-meter span .
Ultrastable profile .
Harness , parachute .
And yeah , that &apos;s all .
Two parachutes .
And this is my life .
It was the sea .
And then I did open my chute .
This is risky stuff indeed .
I assume you have standards .
YR : No , that &apos;s really two worlds .
Civil aviation is something that we know very well .
We have a hundred years of experience .
And you can adapt really precisely .
That means improvise .
That &apos;s my ejection seat .
It &apos;s well said . It &apos;s well said .
YR : I do a roll .
Did you land on the rim , down at the bottom ?
YR : It was down on the bottom .
YR : I have a standard answer .
Perfect answer .
YR : First , to instruct a younger guy .
But this is different .
It gets worse .
These are just a few examples .
Are they interconnected ?
And it turns out to be structured as follows .
It &apos;s actually not that hard to understand .
Let me explain by giving you this analogy .
And it gets even more extreme .
It &apos;s not a street map . &quot;
And this is slowly starting .
Thank you .
It was deep at night .
I do not remember what time it was .
This is my story .
I was that girl .
How interesting .
How interesting .
Checkmate .
That was her fight .
That was her resistance .
There are two sides of war .
She got a support network .
She learned about her rights .
I will meet you there .
Let us all meet in that field .
Thank you .
Why does this matter ?
Thank you .
I &apos;m talking about teachers .
The U.S. isn &apos;t number one .
Eleven out of 14 .
And what we found is very exciting .
I &apos;ll see you later .
I hope you are too .
Thank you .
But despite that cold , you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan .
And there are features that look tectonic .
They look like they &apos;ve been pulled apart .
.
You are looking at a shoreline .
Okay , now , 16 kilometers , eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude .
And here is the horizon , OK ?
These are probably water ice pebbles , yes ?
.
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in .
It is a very geologically active body .
And thank you very much .
Pico Iyer : Where is home ?
Where do you come from ?
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
means &quot; Where do you pay your taxes ?
And if &quot; Where do you come from ? &quot;
They move to New York City .
Or Edinburgh .
Several lifetimes , actually .
He found himself .
And I went down to the room in which I was to be sleeping .
I didn &apos;t consult the monks for guidance .
That &apos;s not the point .
It &apos;s the place where you stand .
Thank you .
So , who am I ?
I am not that caring .
This is me .
This is what happened to me .
And then I got people saying , &quot; Leave him . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to write for this public audience .
But anyways .
His father was a blogger .
So , blogs .
It &apos;s this record of who you are , your persona .
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people .
And so , that &apos;s an amazing thing to consider .
That was an amazing thing .
So , thank you .
And fortunately it &apos;s very simple .
X equals Y.
This might look familiar .
The first step is pattern recognition .
Second step , conceptual synesthesia .
Can we do a quick show of hands ?
Does that correspond ?
Why do we do that ?
Neckties are loud .
Sexually attractive people are hot .
Third step is cognitive dissonance .
You can take the test now .
What should they do ?
Thank you very much .
You just press it .
Oh , man . Um , yes .
Is Bill Gates here ?
Change it ! Come on ! What ?
Ah ! Okay .
As you can see , these are all maps .
It &apos;s time for Bolotnitsa ! &quot;
Djabran Fluctus .
If that don &apos;t flow off the tongue , what does ?
&quot; It fluctus up , Mama . &quot;
Hikuleo Fluctus .
I go to Chrysokeras .
Left to the Thymiamata .
That &apos;s a cool name . I will say that .
And of course there will be advertisements .
Djabran Fluctus .
It &apos;s clear to me . &quot;
I did some more investigation .
Something is askew here .
Is that Mars Ya Marov ?
&quot; Mom , I want to make maps . &quot;
&quot; Yeah , go to your room . &quot;
Martians , Venusians , Jovians .
We have names for places where people don &apos;t exist .
That seems a little silly to me .
There are no Jovians .
Here comes Euler .
You see the icosahedron again .
Which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads .
I suggest the house .
What a coincidence !
And for me , that &apos;s a win-win .
Better really hurry up .
That guy is rockin &apos; .
What a handsome cat .
I don &apos;t get that at all .
This is freaky is a major way .
This is Sierra Leone .
Man . I don &apos;t really need to comment on this .
When did this happen ?
Although five is a good number , of course .
This is , of course , the Cartesian coordinates .
Once again , that &apos;s Sierra Leone .
Descartes .
Before the horse .
They are so different .
Look , ours is more red , it &apos;s longer .
Prime numbers , Gauss , one of my favorites .
&quot; Ten milligram , 20 milligram . &quot;
&quot; Yes , Mama . &quot;
And that didn &apos;t work out well .
Symmetry , pairs .
Bottom , all 74 .
This is beyond anything anybody could just make up .
There is the Orange System .
Unbelievable . This is like crazy .
Not stamps , but one day .
I start looking at that , and look at them again .
They start looking like planets .
Kepler was right .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
What do you want ?
It &apos;s getting near zero .
Thank you .
Jamie , here &apos;s the puzzle to me .
This must drive you crazy .
by which this might happen .
Thank you , thank you .
And she was dark , too .
My mother was English .
It &apos;s totally rad . &quot;
I said , &quot; English , mum . &quot;
But her Igbo wasn &apos;t too good .
I was seven .
And , &quot; Do you notice any discharges ? &quot;
And , &quot; How swollen is your vulva ? &quot;
My mother said , &quot; Someone has to . &quot;
So , this guy comes with me .
I was a wimp .
I cried for a very long time .
Just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult . &quot;
It &apos;s your birthday present . &quot;
He was obsessed .
It &apos;s incredible .
I was really worried .
Then I &apos;d say , &quot; How do you know ? &quot;
They killed him .
This is for you , old man .
Thank you .
It &apos;s actually about humpback whales .
Well , that got us a little angry .
So , there was a clear lesson here .
And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants .
Which is obvious . It &apos;s a great name .
Thank you .
You wouldn &apos;t have any ...
Rapid movement , contrast .
That was like just so super cool .
This is tensor imaging .
Cattle are the same way .
Or do I have something wrong with the equipment ? &quot;
It &apos;s tails , pure and simple .
And let &apos;s talk about jobs .
It just drives me crazy .
That &apos;s the kind of specificity you need .
And I just want to thank everybody for coming .
Oh , you &apos;ve got a question for me ? OK .
What are you most passionate about ?
And it &apos;s very , very simple .
It &apos;s libraries .
TG : Well thank you so much . Thank you .
So , let &apos;s see .
Let &apos;s take a look .
Let &apos;s take a look .
Let me point them out .
Bird flu .
The millennium bug , terrible disaster .
Let me highlight it for you .
Why ?
Why April ?
Let me show you this .
Any other guesses ?
Shopping .
Shall we see ?
Who would do that ?
Your sense of sight is the fastest .
It &apos;s unconscious .
It &apos;s the language of the eye .
It &apos;s got to be America , right ?
Let &apos;s have a look .
Of course , 2.1 million .
Take a look at this one .
I &apos;m a bit of a health nut .
So it spawns itself .
So let &apos;s filter that out .
So it &apos;s cool .
It &apos;s kind of living .
So we can have a look .
And that is beautiful . Thank you .
This is Revolution 2.0 .
Because everyone was a hero .
Everyone has done something .
Everything was going bad .
Everything was going wrong .
Yet , nothing was happening .
In fact , people were extremely frustrated .
Everyone was scared .
There are lots of people who care about their freedom .
It was an educational campaign .
I still remember the photo .
The photo was horrible .
But people did not relate to this .
People did not believe this .
He was a middle-class guy .
A page was created .
Get those who killed this guy .
To just bring them to justice . &quot;
But of course , they don &apos;t listen .
People started contributing ideas .
And next time it &apos;s going to be vibration . &quot;
People were making fun of the idea .
And they were doing this thing .
There was no leader .
The revolution is happening .
But they detained me .
I was not allowed to speak with anyone .
And I went out .
The fear is no longer fear .
People were so empowered .
Completely opposite .
Extremism became tolerance .
Thanks a lot .
You just never know .
It &apos;s important , but not enough .
Your sexual function improves .
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards .
He says , &quot; I &apos;ve got some good news .
Thank you .
It &apos;s hard . It &apos;s durable .
They &apos;ve taken things off the shelf .
And I &apos;ll talk you through this .
That layer is called the periosteum .
We &apos;ve lots of blood vessels in there .
But there &apos;s a difference here .
Thank you .
So that is the House of Tata .
Innovation , compassion and passion .
They combine all that .
And you can see the cartoon here .
Let me tell you a bit about it .
Stretch the envelope . &quot;
Can you believe it ?
Until midnight , he &apos;d be thinking .
But who was the team leader ?
Adhesives were replacing the rivets .
I mean , it was incredible innovation .
And Nano was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
A challenge , of course .
You just don &apos;t have it .
&quot; Did it hurt ? &quot;
&quot; No ... not at all . &quot;
Let &apos;s move to health .
No , I &apos;m sorry .
Let us just take an example .
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars .
Looks absolutely audacious .
Looks absolutely ridiculous .
And how they have been achieved ...
And that is how this difference has come .
It &apos;s not about low cost .
It &apos;s about ultra-low cost .
You &apos;re talking about inclusive innovation .
You know , incubators for infants , for example .
They &apos;re not available in Africa .
And infants die .
And by whom ?
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes .
I &apos;ve still one and a half to go .
What was that ?
What do you think that drove you ?
It was &#91; unclear &#93; high school .
And one of them was &#91; unclear &#93; who taught us physics .
And then he said , &quot; This is the focal length . &quot;
And then the paper burned .
What does that focal length do ?
What does that convex lens do ?
It makes them meet .
The verb is the chassis of the sentence .
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways .
Only humans can possess things .
No one &apos;s fooled .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Nothing ventured , nothing gained .
So this is a rather fraught situation .
Thank you very much .
They &apos;re flying through their space , ocean space .
What do they like to eat ?
What is it that they &apos;re happy with ?
So take a look at that animal .
And this is my favorite .
Three tunas tagged .
On the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they &apos;re mixed populations .
And we &apos;ll wind in the target .
We can save the white shark .
We have the science and technology .
Hope is here . Yes we can .
Thank you .
Charles Leadbeater : The era of open innovation
Why is that ?
Those were the two places .
500 people .
You &apos;ve got two options .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s just going up through the roof .
Matt Keenan : It &apos;s switched on .
Here we go .
We get to do the classic .
All right .
OK .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
OK , here we go .
Sorry .
OK .
32 gram . Sorry , one gram .
Thank you .
You hear about it on your television sets .
It &apos;s brand new .
How did this happen ?
After all , aging is not a piece of cake .
How sad are you right now ?
And there is a slight downturn .
But that &apos;s not the case .
So how can this be ?
We go on blind dates .
We savor life .
The numbers won &apos;t determine the outcome .
Culture will .
Thank you .
Now that &apos;s one thing , of course .
You probably haven &apos;t thought that much about it .
We &apos;re pretty safe here .
New York City .
He apparently had a sense of humor .
You may have heard of it .
But who &apos;s doing even better ?
Thank you .
It &apos;s great stuff .
Now , it &apos;s about 35 percent .
And what goes on in the future ?
Here &apos;s a piece of limestone .
It &apos;s about 400 million years old .
How the molecules are put together .
Here &apos;s a piece of coal .
And so that is my story .
The oil will never run out .
Thank you very much .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to go places . &quot;
&quot; Ah ha ! American , great . &quot;
He said , &quot; What is your father &apos;s name ? &quot;
I said , &quot; He passed away a long time ago .
His name was Jabbar . &quot;
You owe us two billion dollars . &quot;
&quot; Why would I do that ?
Right .
&quot; Well , then blow yourself up .
Just do it outside , please . &quot;
&quot; And furthermore , it is the thought that counts . &quot;
&quot; And in conclusion , win some , lose some . &quot;
Don &apos;t be Hassan . Don &apos;t be Hussein . &quot;
That &apos;s not one of us . &quot;
I was in Oman , and I was in Saudi Arabia .
I was in Dubai .
I was walking . I heard &quot; Beep , beep . &quot;
Out of my way . Out of my way . Out of my way . &quot;
It &apos;s like a drug deal .
Come here . Come here . Come here .
Not in the Middle East .
And they don &apos;t get paid that well .
Have a good day . Thank you .
And what do I mean by that ?
Maybe you had a direct line .
That was where the focus had to be .
100 percent are using text .
Terry Moore : How to tie your shoes
And I think that &apos;s true .
Now as it turns out -- thank you .
Wait , there &apos;s more .
And here &apos;s how to tell .
That &apos;s the weak form of the knot .
But not to worry .
We &apos;re going to do this one more time .
Pull the knot .
Live long and prosper .
What ?
You &apos;re the chaplain .
You should be immune .
Now , don &apos;t , please , misunderstand me .
Don &apos;t let it claim you .
And he answered , &quot; Make friends . &quot;
And he did .
Claim your experience .
Don &apos;t let it claim you .
So what about you ?
Survivor .
No movement , no growth .
Claim your experience .
Sometimes there &apos;s a payoff .
And they left .
And she said , &quot; What ? &quot;
People kept leaving to get coffee .
No matter .
Roger Ebert : Remaking my voice
It was like breathing .
The first surgery was a great success .
My carotid artery had ruptured .
But they were willing to give it a try .
or Roger 2.0 .
The flow isn &apos;t natural .
A very large sample is needed .
But that &apos;s not the point .
Does anybody remember that ? &quot;
But no you don &apos;t .
Excuse me .
I am productive .
The psychiatrist says , &quot; You &apos;re crazy . &quot;
Let &apos;s just get started here .
Okay , just a moment .
All right .
Oh , sorry .
Thank you .
Fission .
It &apos;s pretty hot .
You have to make it from something else .
This is basically why we would bother to do it .
And then we get to uranium .
It gets very expensive to do this research .
But that &apos;s not electricity yet .
We have to get to a power plant .
He was infected with HIV .
But you know what ?
Hands up .
Wow . Wow .
That &apos;s a significant number of us .
And so that &apos;s just programmed into you .
And you &apos;re just like , I &apos;m a very bad person .
Why are you pregnant when you are living positive ? &quot;
I just signed .
These are terrible and tragic figures .
And the trend ? Well the trend is clear .
But awareness needs action .
It hits very close to home .
Thank you .
Everything is interconnected .
There were no clouds in the sky .
And after a while I began to perspire .
That &apos;s part of you up there .
I &apos;ve learned to respect the lightning .
My hair used to be straight .
I &apos;m just kidding .
They become lovely monsters .
What is your motive for action ?
Because that &apos;s what I got hired to do .
How do you make a change ?
Audience : Aye .
Supreme Court .
Audience : Aye .
Audience : Yes .
Audience : Aye .
Say , &quot; Aye . &quot;
Audience : Aye .
Audience : Aye .
Audience : Aye .
It &apos;s been fantastic .
Thank you .
The last thing is emotion .
How may know somebody like this ? Come on .
10 seconds .
Side street in Italy .
Curves against sharp things .
Thank you very much .
And this will be my only comment on it .
The experiments are incredibly simple .
The chromosome is literally blown apart .
These are complex issues .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
We &apos;ve got about a minute left .
Thanks very much . There &apos;s always lots more .
Amazing . Amazing performance .
And definitely my life has been part of that .
And it &apos;s not based on an a priori notion .
It doesn &apos;t work that way for me at all .
I have no interest in that whatsoever .
And as it moves , it takes pieces of the earth with it . It bends up .
And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself .
And , again , all of it promoting transparency .
They &apos;re just totally incredible .
And it &apos;s that territory of -- it &apos;s this thing .
Thank you so much .
And this is one of those examples of the sets .
I work with a group of other architects .
Thanks very much .
See , for instance , in this picture .
I just did things .
And I called them relics .
This is the clown skull .
This is the Ashanti joystick .
The rocking podium .
The Bonsai table .
&quot; The Snail . &quot;
&quot; The Teapot . &quot;
And he did something that was very tricky .
And it &apos;s totally overkill .
&quot; Relaxation . &quot;
&quot; Fiat Lux . &quot;
And I wanted to deal with other subjects .
So this is a lighthouse .
I got some photographs from them .
&quot; Valicia . &quot;
&quot; Jacynthe . &quot;
So they &apos;re called &quot; Pictures of Chocolate . &quot;
&quot; Paparazzi . &quot;
This is a pipe .
A hanger .
Well , I think that &apos;s it .
My time is nearly up .
Thank you very much .
And I said , &quot; Yeah .
But I was in for the adventure .
Where do these exist ?
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands .
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands .
Because that &apos;s where all the ocean is . &quot;
And it certainly was .
You can read them yourselves .
Where eventually do we take this ?
Thank you very much .
Jake Barton : The museum of you
This is Charley Williams .
The idea is very , very simple .
Where &apos;s the right finger ?
So it seems right .
Voice 7 : It was probably about 11 o &apos;clock at night .
Voice 10 : Trying to frantically get to a radio .
Voice 15 : So I switched on the television .
Voice 17 : The Twin Towers . Voice 18 : The Twin Towers .
This is the so-called slurry wall .
Thank you very much .
Imagine , if you will -- a gift .
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
It will bring all of your family together .
Flowers will arrive by the truckload .
The price ?
Does Amazon carry it ?
Does it have the Apple logo on it ?
Is there a waiting list ?
Not likely .
And this , and then this .
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
How has this happened ?
There was amazing improvements .
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host .
And yet , nobody listened to them .
It isn &apos;t .
A million properties have been returned .
The national army has shrunk .
It &apos;s about context .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
We could have done that .
Rory , thank you very much .
RS : Thank you .
What I want to talk about today is one idea .
We started with two schools .
Thank you very much .
Jack Horner : Where are the baby dinosaurs ?
None , huh ?
All right .
We &apos;re going to kind of go in a different direction right now .
That &apos;s it .
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs .
And there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
Lots of different kinds .
And this is an interesting story .
They &apos;re all big .
Where are all the little ones ? &quot;
Now think about that .
So this was interesting .
You go into a museum and they take really good care of them .
They &apos;re very well taken care of .
So that &apos;s what I do .
So it &apos;s real easy to tell them apart .
So what I want to do is show you these .
And so we will evaluate them .
And that &apos;s sort of what I &apos;ve been doing .
they say , &quot; Go away . &quot;
And we want to look at these three first .
But it didn &apos;t give them a clue .
So it is going to get bigger .
It &apos;s inflating very fast .
Okay .
Because everybody wants to have a big one .
They &apos;re everywhere . They &apos;re all over the place .
And that &apos;s pretty cool .
It &apos;s a big skull .
&quot; And it has holes in its frill . &quot;
Anatotitan : giant duck .
And we get rid of Anatotitan .
And that &apos;s a good number .
That &apos;s a good number to go extinct , I think .
And they &apos;re not happy with this .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s now 2.7 degrees .
And that amazes me .
Thanks a lot .
Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper .
Sticker templates .
Making a switch .
Sketching an interface .
And I &apos;ll kind of let it speak for itself .
So thank you very much .
A beard full of bees .
We don &apos;t even find dead bodies .
Again , a bit counterintuitive .
They don &apos;t experience this .
What can we do here ?
So , what I do is honeybee research .
Thank you .
And this is Codex C here .
It &apos;s buried treasure .
Because this book is actually a prayer book .
Why did he buy this book ?
And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds .
And that &apos;s what it looks like .
How were we going to do that ?
And that electron disappears .
It sheds an X-ray .
Because the ink was written in iron .
So what did we discover ?
Anyone want to guess the answer ?
Consider the Spartans .
And we found three .
And that &apos;s what he did .
Thank you very much indeed .
We did all kinds of research .
Busy , busy work .
I have no doubt about it .
No , no .
It &apos;s a little bit like termites , really .
Thank you .
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks .
It &apos;s a mystery .
I saw forests and meadows .
Or take this sea cucumber .
Or the blowfish .
Let &apos;s see .
Try and inflate it .
Or take this swordfish .
Or this lionfish for instance .
He &apos;s a great white shark .
He &apos;s kind of just out there making a living .
Plastic just is not going to do it . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t fit them in .
It &apos;s cruel , it &apos;s wasteful .
And then he dies .
Ostensibly , he &apos;s dead now .
Sherman &apos;s up in shark heaven .
You can kind of do anything .
Thanks .
You &apos;ve been given one tool , a hammer .
And then some yells , &quot; Stop ! &quot;
And they turn up the lights .
Thanks for listening .
The world needs you , badly .
There is going to be no turning back .
Find out what they are .
And I thank you for having me here tonight .
Oh , thank you .
Thank you very much .
I salute you .
But they do .
The second of these is the biophony .
This is Lincoln Meadow .
There were a lot of them .
This is after selective logging .
And they do that for two reasons .
Yeah . Well .
Thank you for listening .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prototype .
And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
So this is a very early prototype .
And there &apos;s no wires .
Thank you .
Africa is booming .
It &apos;s that quick .
The private sector as well .
Ten percent &apos;s come from India .
And they &apos;re investing in energy .
A bit dangerous , sometimes .
Nobody else did .
This is how I look at Africa .
South Africa is playing a role .
Fragile democracies is the beige color .
Strong democracies are the orange color .
Why does that matter ?
He won by a margin .
No offense .
And you know what ?
Buy African products .
Invest .
Thank you very much .
And everything is managed by the volunteers .
How does it work ?
So real-time peer review .
It just isn &apos;t appropriate .
Thank you .
We &apos;re going to call him &quot; Ted . &quot;
We &apos;re going to call that guy &quot; Bill . &quot;
Bill &apos;s hasn &apos;t .
The societal one is a lot more challenging .
I witnessed this firsthand .
So the green shoots are out there .
Thank you very much .
And he &apos;s going into a diner .
It would be a big seller .
You see them on the mountains up there .
And this leads to oddities .
Now I &apos;m a middle-aged guy .
I &apos;m not exactly comfortable with emotions .
It was just sheer terror .
Babies come with this ability .
He wagged his tongue at the baby .
The baby wagged her tongue back .
They are curious .
It seems so elementary .
But this is the source of innovation .
Thank you .
But what did he appeal to ?
Invest , invest , invest . &quot;
And he appealed to virtue .
Virtue is an old-fashioned word .
Let me begin with an example .
Not one .
It &apos;s scary .
So he brought it back .
But not so fast .
Fair enough .
Better ones , more of them .
Better ones , more of them .
Regulate , regulate , regulate .
It &apos;s preposterous on its face .
And they prevent disaster .
Now , how about incentives ?
They seem cleverer .
Right ?
Well , not always .
They knew it was dangerous .
So what can we do ?
One : Celebrate moral exemplars .
Well , acknowledge them .
Celebrate them .
Two were particularly inspiring to me .
There are ordinary heroes .
Someone is always watching .
The camera is always on .
Obama appealed to virtue .
And I think he was right .
He also appealed to hope .
Right again .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
And on this axis , I &apos;m showing dollars per person in income .
And , up there , you see Uganda .
Now , what has happened ?
So , ready , steady , go !
They went upwards like this .
And almost the same happens here .
We have to stop that .
No , it &apos;s not . Look here .
So , is it poverty ?
Look here at Kenya .
I &apos;ve split Kenya in its provinces .
Here it goes .
So , what is it then ?
Southeast Asia , and so on .
It could be some virus types .
Probably , it &apos;s a combination of this .
Thank you very much .
Now , I &apos;m an ethnobotanist .
It didn &apos;t work .
When it came back , I went to see the shaman again .
Who would you rather be treated by ?
Where &apos;s the cure for breast cancer ?
Where &apos;s the cure for insomnia ?
This is the magic frog .
The shaman said , &quot; No , I did not . &quot;
Western medicine can &apos;t touch those . I cure them . &quot;
It &apos;s found in the Amazon as well .
They &apos;re known to be man-eaters .
Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay .
This is a form of resistance .
Here &apos;s why .
The elders are the libraries .
No scientist has been atop them .
But the world is changing .
It &apos;s called human safaris .
What &apos;s to be done ?
Some of them were massacred .
Let &apos;s think differently .
Thanks again .
So this was chapter one .
It was absolutely incredible .
It was just completely off the wall .
It was just really , really frightening .
They are stateless .
And they &apos;re retaliation-proof .
It becomes very portable .
It &apos;s very unsettling .
This is the ultimate .
You assume that .
You &apos;ve got to get out of there .
They are paralyzed .
Thank you .
I brought this with me .
So it looks something like this .
I &apos;ll show you .
No , it -- well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias .
Sort of an interesting thing .
It &apos;s a way of thinking about things .
There &apos;s nothing more to it than that .
You can say a miracle occurs .
And , of course , happy faces .
Do you see him there ?
Little froggy legs .
Religious iconography .
I actually went to see this one .
What did you get ?
And in England , there &apos;s a pop singer .
And she wrote a beautiful song .
And she has this one passage here .
At least she got it close .
And said , &quot; I &apos;m so embarrassed .
Let &apos;s look at this cartoon .
&quot; Discouraging data on the antidepressant . &quot;
Indeed , it is discouraging .
This person rated it a two .
Humor is a type of entertainment .
Where is the danger going to exist ?
How are you going to manage it ?
Here &apos;s one of his cartoons .
Bob Mankoff : &quot; Oooh , no .
Ehhh .
Oooh . Hmm . Too funny .
I &apos;ll enjoy it on my own . Perhaps .
No . Nah . No .
Overdrawn . Underdrawn .
Drawn just right , still not funny enough .
No . No .
For God &apos;s sake no , a thousand times no .
Eh , no .
No . No .
Definitely no . &#91; Several hours after lunch &#93; No . Get out of here .
&quot; I &apos;m thinking about having a child . &quot;
&quot; Ass-head . Please help . &quot;
One way to look at it is this .
You want to be transgressed .
Voice : Here we go .
&quot; Too snug ? &quot;
Here &apos;s another cartoon .
Humor does need a target .
Different frames of reference .
&quot; You slept with her , didn &apos;t you ? &quot;
&quot; Lassie ! Get help ! ! &quot;
It &apos;s called French Army Knife .
Thank you .
Thank you .
These are gecko toes .
And here is its first test .
More recently , this happened .
How do you know ?
Here is the actual robot .
And here is what it does .
If we can show some of the video , you can see it climbing up the wall .
There it is .
We know that you can grab onto things with them .
It can also act as a counterbalance .
So watch this kangaroo .
See that tail ? That &apos;s incredible !
It can also be used in defense .
Pretty powerful .
So here is normal speed .
And watch it now slip , and see what it does with its tail .
This is incredible .
They &apos;re climbing up a wall , or a tree .
And this is what we discovered .
But there it is slowed down .
But geckos do it better .
And they do it with their tail .
If we could have the lights on it .
Okay , there it goes .
And show the video .
There it is .
So we can maneuver this way .
It can actually swim through the air .
Stay tuned for that .
And it certainly looks like it .
Watch the animal .
Watch the whip of its tail as it does it . Look at that .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
You see it there ? There ? Watch it come down .
Better to err on the side of caution .
Don &apos;t feel ashamed .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
The Earth always did have limits .
They were just beyond our sights .
There are still no limits .
There will always be another frontier .
The oil is not liquid .
That &apos;s a person down there by the wheel .
It &apos;s not even mining .
It is terrestrial skinning .
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot .
There is no escape hatch .
Thank you .
But I &apos;m not engaged in doing that .
I don &apos;t have a clue .
Now , what is game theory about ?
Now who is rational ?
You know , what if people are rational ?
Five factorial is 120 .
No . How about 10 times ?
To 1,200 ? No .
Nobody can keep that straight in their head .
Alright , lets turn to Iran .
What &apos;s its future ?
How is this happening ?
Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad .
He is on the way down .
One question for you .
That was fascinating .
I love that you put it out there .
BBM : Thank you .
So I have a strange career .
No , no , I wasn &apos;t 14 years old .
And I was actually a rocket scientist .
But it was an exciting experience .
I said , &quot; I have no idea . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Really ?
Because isn &apos;t that easy ?
I mean , we have life .
But here &apos;s something . &quot;
Anyone know ?
It &apos;s actually not life , it &apos;s a crystal .
So can life be defined ?
Well how would you go about it ?
And then you might get something .
But what is this system like ?
And this process goes on and on and on .
And here &apos;s the result .
In this case , the frequency is lower .
So let &apos;s see what that looks like .
Too hot , too hot .
And of course , it reaches the viability threshold .
You hit the viability threshold .
The distribution changes to &quot; alive ! &quot;
And then that signature is lost .
What do we learn from that ?
Well , I think we learn a number of things from that .
And I &apos;m going to leave you with that .
And thank you very much .
Jonas Gahr Støre : In defense of dialogue
After 9 / 11 , either you were with us or against us .
It was black or white .
Now I &apos;m not naive .
And there are times you should walk .
Let us turn to Afghanistan .
Now everybody agrees .
And you can always walk .
Let me go one step further .
This is Tahrir Square .
And who knows what it will be called in the end .
That &apos;s not the point .
Should we talk to Hamas ?
I think that is wrong .
It &apos;s their right to fight . &quot;
Sometimes you have to .
But that strategy seldom takes you very far .
Thank you for your attention .
Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
Fear-induced heart failure .
Self-injury .
A physician .
Thank you .
People thought about , &quot; Oh , my God .
People are going to be hurt .
No , I &apos;m going to be virtuous .
We feel so good about ourselves .
Maybe I &apos;ll feel good myself .
&quot; You &apos;ve served so well . &quot;
But that &apos;s not actually what happens .
That bottle winds up getting burned .
But guess what ?
A clamshell &apos;s hard .
That should be the goal .
Just so proud .
And , yeah , I &apos;m proud , too .
Thank you very much .
So a high I.Q.
Thank you .
Angella Ahn : Thank you .
Thank you so much .
And he insisted on beautiful music .
Thank you .
Why is this happening ?
I call them the Net Generation .
It &apos;s like the air .
I &apos;m a digital immigrant .
Now , what is openness ?
The first is collaboration .
I &apos;ve read some of your books . &quot;
It &apos;s not about hooking up online .
Openness is about collaboration .
You say you have good products .
But you also need to have values .
So this is good . It &apos;s not bad .
Sunlight is the best disinfectant .
Now this is different than transparency .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble .
Do you know about this ?
Now , take the Arab Spring .
The toothpaste is out of the tube .
People didn &apos;t know about things .
There was no concept of progress .
You were born , you lived your life and you died .
It protects the birds .
This is a huge collaboration .
Let &apos;s do this . Thank you .
That &apos;s great .
That &apos;s how they &apos;re created .
But check this out .
In fact , here &apos;s another one .
Let &apos;s see what we get there .
So one plus one plus four is six .
Add nine to that , we get 15 .
Add 25 , we get 40 .
Now look at those numbers .
Fibonacci ! Of course .
That &apos;s the area .
Now check this out .
Thank you very much .
First is physiological .
This is surf .
Natural sound can do that too .
Try and listen to the other one .
This is important .
And , finally , test and test it again .
That &apos;s her competition .
She &apos;s under the underdogs .
So what &apos;s the connection ?
We &apos;re not fast .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
The pack stays together .
We try to cash in on it .
Humans ran and ran all the time .
I &apos;ve experienced it personally myself .
Let &apos;s start with day and night .
So , we have this ability as well .
So , cut to the modern day .
Thank you .
So why are they succeeding ?
I believe , number one , it &apos;s complacency .
I was also pregnant at the time .
Thank you .
Many people were inspired by this .
This was kind of the defining slogan .
Well I took one year .
This is called a cycle valve tube .
It &apos;s like its own little coupling .
But this is very shaky .
Push it and it becomes house shaped .
It becomes kite-shaped .
Why use triangles ?
Now this is people science .
Put this on top .
You just need a ton .
You can play around with it .
You put a little sticky tape .
And this is the pump .
It &apos;s like a centrifuge .
Right .
There are four pictures .
They all study about the food chain .
In three minutes , you just fold this up .
This is a straw .
This is a kind of a blowing straw .
I just put this inside this .
There &apos;s a hole here , and I shut this .
This is a permanent magnet .
We made 30,000 .
You put this in your mouth , and you blow .
And something very , very nice happens .
This is a touching slate meant for blind children .
And this is wool over here .
Wool sticks on Velcro .
This is very , very simple .
These are two magnets .
Small pulley and two strong magnets .
It &apos;s a great cricket cap .
This is called &quot; The Captain &apos;s Hat Story . &quot;
It goes very slowly .
So that &apos;s a ship .
They were singing and dancing .
And there &apos;s a third one over here .
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down .
Thank you so much .
It is going to extend its legs out .
Now , what about the engine ?
The halteres are actually gyroscopes .
And is it fair to say that it &apos;s simple ?
It &apos;s a very smart , smart audience .
They have to engage in courtship .
But I would argue that flies do more .
Wait for it .
Pshhew .
And I &apos;ll expand this up .
And I don &apos;t mean chewing the crabs .
And this is what one of these experiments looks like .
And it was here that I met Jane .
And so she ultimately turned to prostitution .
She started tailoring .
And so she can &apos;t move out .
I said , &quot; Well what about your dreams ? &quot;
And I say , &apos; Look at me . You are not dead .
Thank you .
Misha Glenny : Hire the hackers !
We are everyone . We are no one .
We are but the base of chaos .
And they &apos;re pretty scary .
&quot; What do we do now ?
Okay , they &apos;re a little inchoate .
And I sort of get it .
So there you are .
They &apos;re completely anonymous , as it were .
And he did a great job in it .
And let me be blunt about this .
Thank you very much for listening .
We want to work with you . &quot;
That &apos;s older than my dad .
That &apos;s next to impossible .
However , there &apos;s a catch .
So that &apos;s why I chose to use paper .
My mom wouldn &apos;t really like that .
You &apos;re going to save us all ! &quot;
However , there was a silver lining .
So I went in that direction .
How unlikely is that ? I mean , pshhh .
But it wouldn &apos;t stop there .
It &apos;s just your ideas that count .
You could be changing the world .
Thank you .
Yes . That &apos;s right . This is Barbie .
I want to show you two examples .
: Video clips from across the globe .
The USA .
It &apos;s now a theme park .
And someone asked , &quot; Why ? &quot;
So , starting with the political philosophy .
Of course we don &apos;t .
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age .
How do you do it ?
Other examples are recycling .
How do we make it happen ?
Thank you .
My job depends upon it .
It &apos;s silent gesture .
You overcompensate .
Bugger me , they wouldn &apos;t give it to me .
If you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
If you hold it too loosely , it flies away . &quot;
Let &apos;s be under no illusions .
Simply through singing .
One of them was &quot; Carmen . &quot;
They don &apos;t read music .
They trust their ears .
Why is this ?
Now hang on a minute .
T , see it &apos;s the same as F in music .
So T is F.
So T , E , D is the same as F , E , D.
Have a listen .
Do you hear it ?
Or do I smell some doubt in the room ?
If you &apos;ll pardon the expression .
Oh my goodness me , there it was loud and clear , surely .
I think we should make this even more explicit .
Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea , I think ?
Will you have a go for me ?
Audience : T , E , D.
Shall we try that one again ?
T , E , D.
Audience : T , E , D.
One more time , with feeling , ladies and gentlemen .
You won &apos;t make the key otherwise .
Well done , ladies and gentlemen .
It &apos;s called Paraorchestra .
No one &apos;s responding to each other .
Can I do that one again ?
I become alive .
It &apos;s removed some of my paralysis .
He was from North Texas .
They were on their own .
Why is that ?
Why has that happened ?
I don &apos;t want to have a conversation about that today .
How do we do that ?
We have to say , all right .
I &apos;ll just mention a few .
Now , it was logistically difficult .
And we were talking about his life .
I &apos;ve read the records .
I know that she tried to kill you . &quot;
Thank you .
He &apos;s actually here today .
Fishnet stockings .
My mom says , &quot; patriarchy . &quot;
I say , &quot; intersectionality . &quot;
Thank you .
My mom says , &quot; Protest march . &quot;
I say , &quot; Online organizing . &quot;
Thank you .
Which brings me to my third paradox .
I was listening to her talk on the phone , which she did a lot .
It &apos;s about embracing the paradox .
And it &apos;s about loving people really well .
Thank you .
Effectively , this is the brainwashing process that has begun .
I want you to watch another excerpt from the film .
This boy is called Zenola .
This boy is called Sadik .
He killed 22 .
This boy is called Messoud .
He killed 28 .
Boy : I would love to .
Then God will look at my intention .
Thank you .
Who is ever going to hire me ? &quot;
Go around Congress .
Thank you all so much .
I don &apos;t need to go into that .
This is in Portland . That is an actual development .
This is a bio-morphic building .
Yeah , it &apos;s a fabulous movie if you haven &apos;t seen it .
Another world is possible .
We tweak that a lot .
You get access to distance medicine .
And we have new tools .
Does anyone know what this is ?
Alex Steffen : Exactly , this is a landmine-detecting flower .
Thank you very much .
This means , &quot; I &apos;m smiling . &quot;
So does that .
This means &quot; mouse . &quot;
&quot; Cat . &quot;
Here &apos;s where it happens .
These are when .
She wears it every day .
That &apos;s because she dances .
or &quot; I heart you ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m laughing out loud . &quot;
&quot; I want to give you a hug . &quot;
But he comes up with that , you know .
Put a crab inside it .
Add some water .
Seven different salts .
And the girl goes , &quot; Wha &apos; ? &quot;
At least , that &apos;s how it seems .
She just says , &quot; No thank you . &quot;
You know ?
We &apos;re all liars .
My husband &apos;s like , &quot; Honey , deception ?
We say , &quot; Nice song . &quot;
So sorry . &quot;
That &apos;s seven percent of revenues .
He said , &quot; Look , I &apos;ve got one rule . &quot;
And that &apos;s the crux of it .
And we all kind of hate to admit it .
Now you may think that &apos;s bad .
Lying &apos;s complex .
It &apos;s as old as breathing .
Now you might remember Koko .
Here &apos;s Koko with her kitten .
How early ?
What do you do ?
We &apos;re going to start with speech .
I &apos;m going to say this again .
Thank you .
Pamela Meyer : Okay , what were the telltale signs ?
Freud had it right .
Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit .
Now we &apos;re going to look at the hot spots .
An honest person is going to be cooperative .
They &apos;re going to be enthusiastic .
It &apos;s associated with moral superiority .
Here &apos;s what it looks like .
Now here &apos;s the deal .
They &apos;re not proof of deception .
We &apos;re human beings .
That bothers me the most .
It &apos;s a much more noisy world .
Canadian group , undoubtedly .
You &apos;re too lazy to do it . It &apos;s too hard .
Hmm . Not .
I say , &quot; Do you have passion ? &quot;
&quot; I have an interest , &quot; you say .
Your interest is compared to what ?
&quot; Well , I &apos;m interested in this . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not interested in them . &quot;
&quot; No . Not exactly . &quot;
He was an economically rational person .
Let us merge our interests . &quot;
Yes he did .
Velcro , indeed .
One was a great career .
One was a missed opportunity .
What do you want me to say ?
What a wimp .
And what do you say ?
And what are you going to say ?
You know what you &apos;re going to say ?
Or , are you going to tell him this ?
&quot; I had a dream once , kid .
But then you were born . &quot;
You know why .
You &apos;re afraid to pursue your passion .
But you &apos;re afraid .
Unless .
Thank you .
That &apos;s the theme of my talk .
You smell money . &quot;
The pyramid of ocean life ...
It &apos;s that pyramid .
PCBs accumulate .
And what &apos;s that ?
In mother &apos;s milk .
Those females , they &apos;re not trying to .
That &apos;s another story .
These women have toxic breast milk .
Why does that happen ?
So what do you do ?
Well , there &apos;s a bunch of things you could do .
Monterey is one of those .
It didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
Thank you very much .
And that was enormously liberating to me .
And this is Battista .
Whoops ! Passed each other .
Or even &quot; French . &quot;
And so he did .
I could make nothing of that .
So , it was going nowhere .
That &apos;s what happens .
I was really desperate at this point .
It says &quot; dreams &quot; at the top .
There &apos;s a significant difference .
This could be embarrassing .
Now , this is a little illusion .
But , we don &apos;t have time .
Whatever . &quot;
OK .
Thank you .
&quot; You are being watched .
Actually , you are .
You are being watched . &quot;
We were to keep quiet .
They cross over .
So listen to how I sound .
I was very disconcerted by that .
Poor , deluded fool .
I was no son of his .
I lost my hatred of my father .
I was almost a foot taller than my father .
Thank you .
Actually it gets weirder .
CO : My car is in my living room .
And there &apos;s two of me .
The other point is that it is hard .
This is the curve for Joplin .
There &apos;s a gap here .
MO : Data .
But who knows that ?
CO : And we needed help .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on .
MO : It &apos;s not rocket science .
CO : And that makes a difference .
MO : All right . Let &apos;s go .
His name is the Dalai Lama .
Right ?
This is a soul disc .
These were modern people .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to convince you of today .
So there are three things I want to do .
In the early &apos; 80s , some would say .
But there was no money in it , OK ?
The gang had no way to make money .
Marijuana &apos;s too cheap , it turns out .
You can &apos;t get rich selling marijuana .
You couldn &apos;t sell cocaine .
Then along comes crack cocaine .
I don &apos;t have time to talk about it today .
It had a huge impact on life .
So what was it about crack cocaine ?
So for fifteen minutes , you get this great high .
It created a wonderful market .
He &apos;s a South Asian -- very dark-skinned South Asian .
Gets to the first building .
The first building ? Well , there &apos;s nobody there .
And the mantra was : shoot first ; ask questions later .
Now , Sudhir was lucky .
In a lot of different respects -- the restaurant McDonald &apos;s .
So here &apos;s what the org chart of the gang looks like .
They are the entrepreneurs .
Extremely dangerous work .
OK , just like McDonald &apos;s .
And indeed , it &apos;s not just by chance that they &apos;re like them .
Truly , you would be a great success story .
The money looks about the same .
So , with shooting at you , what are the death rates ?
That is about as high as you can get .
That &apos;s extremely high .
So I have a couple minutes .
So economists tend to talk in technical words .
Here &apos;s an economic principle .
So it turns out -- I &apos;m sort of getting ahead of myself .
It &apos;s exactly this concept .
Here &apos;s another one .
They &apos;re going to come into your neighborhood .
So that &apos;s exactly the same concept .
So one thing we observed in the data is that it looked like , in terms of ...
Thank you very much .
Great . Double-check .
Make sure you still have them on you .
How &apos;d you do ? Show of hands . Did we get it ?
Close your eyes .
Make your best guess .
Now open your eyes .
By a show of hands , were you right ?
So Frank is sitting at a desk .
Do you have an American Express in your wallet ?
Just hold still where you are .
Hello , how are you ? It &apos;s lovely to see you .
You did a wonderful job onstage .
Do you have your ring as well ?
Hi , how are you ? Good to see you .
Oh , you &apos;re married . You follow directions well .
That &apos;s nice to meet you , sir .
Hopefully so . Have a seat . There you go . You &apos;re doing well .
Hi , sir , how are you ?
Come on up this way , Joe .
Give Joe a round of applause .
Pardon me .
Thank you very much . I appreciate that .
Can you stand right over this way for me ?
It was a big miscommunication .
Open your hand . Thank you very much .
Make it harder for me . Just use your hand .
Did you see it go ?
Go ahead and take it off .
Now , let &apos;s try that again .
Hold your hand out flat . Open it up all the way .
It &apos;s back on your shoulder .
Joe : Money .
It &apos;s not back on your shoulder .
Did you see it go ?
Step over this way for me .
Hopefully it matches his taste .
Joe , thank you very much .
What am I wearing ?
Thank you .
And the first mate hesitates .
He &apos;s like , &quot; You idiot . You moron .
He throws the first mate to the ground .
Hilarity ensues .
There is first , the present self .
It &apos;s physically possible to lose weight .
But resisting temptation is hard .
I mean , let &apos;s face it , the present self is present .
It &apos;s in control . It &apos;s in power right now .
It doesn &apos;t even have a lawyer present .
Now I &apos;m a big fan of commitment devices actually .
I mean , you can &apos;t burn it ; that &apos;s illegal .
Such it is with commitment devices .
I think self-discipline is something , it &apos;s like a muscle .
The more you exercise it , the stronger it gets .
And this is a timely issue .
I &apos;m talking about the topic of saving .
It wants to consume .
So what can we do about this ?
And I &apos;ll show you some of these tools right here .
The first is called the distribution builder .
So this is one of our experiments .
And then it &apos;s a high savings rate .
And I &apos;ll close it there .
Thank you .
Women , a majority of the workplace .
Now what does that mean ?
There we go .
So what &apos;s that about ?
But of course , it &apos;s not about that .
You would be issuing orders from above .
You would be very hierarchical .
And here the story is fairly simple .
Noa : The girls are obviously smarter .
They learn much faster .
They are more controlled .
Hanna Rosin : And why is that ?
So who were they ?
&quot; That &apos;s your salary .
&quot; Who &apos;s the damn man ?
She &apos;s the man now . &quot;
It &apos;s happening all over the world .
And now look at the chart .
How much do you prefer a first-born son ?
You &apos;ve got Lady Gaga .
You can bring your husband along .
Thanks very much .
And there should be a pencil .
Come on : those masterpieces ...
OK ? Stop . All right , now .
Lots of laughter , quite a bit of embarrassment .
Yup , yup , I think I probably am .
Now , that wasn &apos;t just self-indulgence .
And I forgot to bring one up with me .
Thank you . All right .
There we go .
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
Some of you haven &apos;t fired them yet .
All right . This is pretty good ; this is pretty good .
Okay , all right . Let &apos;s -- I suppose we &apos;d better ...
So , ah , that was fun .
All right , good .
So , OK , so why ?
But why is it important ?
We need to figure that out pretty fast .
Well , at least , we did once .
Well , not necessarily .
So , everybody ready ? OK ? Off you go .
Okay . Put down your pencils , as they say .
So , who got more than five circles figured out ?
Great . Cool . So I was really interested in quantity .
And somehow that seems wrong .
And they were doing that through building prototypes .
It &apos;s classically learning by doing .
Something like a service or an experience ?
We &apos;re trying on these experiences .
The kind of little face , the portrait you did ?
You can be serious and play .
Thank you very much .
This is Benki .
Benki knew this .
But he wasn &apos;t dismayed .
Why are you putting yourself at risk ?
And what am I doing ? &quot;
We &apos;re running out of fresh water .
We &apos;re running out of fossil fuels .
We &apos;re running out of land .
But you know all that .
He said , &quot; Change ?
Why change ?
Things are bad enough as they are . &quot;
We have to change .
This is Sanghamitra .
Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore .
Even that wasn &apos;t enough .
It &apos;s the spirit inside . &quot;
This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan .
Why did he do all this ?
They have drive , passion , commitment .
And they have humility .
It just happens .
We can learn from what they &apos;ve learned .
Thank you .
They began to meander less .
There was less erosion . The channels narrowed .
But the opposite happened .
Why would that possibly have happened ?
Elephants .
It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant .
Thank you .
I get sick . You get sick .
Is it something that we survive ?
Is it something that we can treat ?
He thought it was transmitted by mosquitos .
And this is what those people signed up for .
But people volunteered for this .
And it &apos;s an accident .
And it &apos;s getting worse .
And no one could tell me yes .
You can start analyzing the data .
Thank you .
They wouldn &apos;t go listen to him .
But the young people all came .
It just becomes intolerable .
It would be terrible .
It &apos;s totally strange .
And then it &apos;s never good enough .
And so then he looks at me .
It &apos;s really lovely .
The human being is almost out of time .
And he would have tremendous fun doing that .
It is Nirvana .
Thank you .
And it goes on and on .
Take a look at these .
But we have a problem .
Thank you very much .
And language is actually a problem here .
The question is , was it worth it ?
So I &apos;ll give you four .
We &apos;re really good at small numbers .
So back to economics .
And there are two ways to do this .
Well , a poor understanding .
Not enough examples .
There aren &apos;t enough examples of failures .
So let me complicate things .
I have feeling and reality .
That &apos;s basically the difference .
You don &apos;t need a model .
I was born in New York City .
A lot of models come from science .
Health models are a great example .
So models can change .
Models are not static .
And we &apos;re good at it .
Intuitive is just another word for familiar .
This kind of thing happens a lot .
I think it depends on the observer .
And I call that their agenda .
This is not uncommon .
Think about seat belts .
Models are hard to dislodge .
Global warming is a great example .
We can do to the next harvest .
But 80 years , we &apos;re just not good at .
I flew here yesterday .
And that &apos;s okay .
Change happens slowly .
Some of this stuff is hard .
We don &apos;t know .
This terrified people .
I &apos;ll give you one , a syringe .
I visit her in the hospital .
I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s kind of neat .
I go home , I look it up .
It basically never happens .
Thank you .
I can &apos;t make noise .
Extremely profound experience .
It &apos;s called &quot; Aria . &quot;
And there &apos;s different text .
So , what is a black hole ?
And I &apos;m going to only talk about the mass .
So , this is a little tricky .
At that point gravity wins .
And then it &apos;s a black hole .
I only need two things .
There are big ones . There are little ones .
It &apos;s way more energetic .
There are also jets emanating out from the center .
And that is because of the atmosphere .
You can see a lot of stars .
Now , truth in advertising . Right ?
And that &apos;s the fun .
It strips that gas cloud apart .
The old ones are red .
There is a dearth of old stars .
So , this is the fun part .
Thanks very much .
And you must be wondering , &quot; What on Earth ?
Have they put up the wrong slide ? &quot;
No , no .
This is TED .
This is the ancestor of cattle .
This is the Oryx .
They &apos;re just as natural as cows .
They have evolved over millennia .
Here &apos;s my proposal .
They don &apos;t own them .
You can &apos;t own your children .
I don &apos;t think so .
But now I &apos;m going to move on .
Back to the cow .
That &apos;s the steward .
I &apos;m going to talk about sheep , too .
What a deal .
Except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the sheep &apos;s cleverness .
It wasn &apos;t the cleverness of the sheep at all .
Whose clever move was it ?
Evolution is cleverer than you are .
And why was the ant doing it ?
It was sort of a spooky story .
Lancet flukes aren &apos;t smart .
It doesn &apos;t have to be .
Here &apos;s what he said .
98 percent .
Now , I talked to Paul afterwards .
And how can we do that ?
Anybody know what this is ?
I &apos;ll tell you what it is .
Here &apos;s a big crowd .
Martians would be amazed by this .
The ant isn &apos;t alone .
True story .
I &apos;m talking also about Christianity .
And on it it says , in Latin : &quot; Semen est verbum Dei . Sator autem Christus .
I &apos;ll give you a few quotes .
&quot; The heart of worship is surrender .
Those words are by Rick Warren .
You &apos;ve all got a copy .
You &apos;ve just heard the man .
First of all , the goal .
Is it a good goal ?
He &apos;s absolutely right .
I give him an A + on this .
Yes .
30 million copies of this book .
Al Gore , eat your heart out .
I don &apos;t have to tell you this .
You &apos;ve just heard the man .
Excellent insights into human psychology , wise advice on every page .
I really appreciated that .
Just enough repetition .
That &apos;s really important .
Thank you .
And now we come to my problem .
My problem is , some of the bits in it I don &apos;t think are true .
That &apos;s worth mentioning .
Now , I just do not believe that .
And here I think , &quot; Wait a minute . &quot;
I read this again .
Is he endorsing creationism here ? &quot;
And you can &apos;t tell .
I think that &apos;s false .
And here &apos;s one that does concern me .
And that &apos;s a problem .
&quot; Don &apos;t ever argue with the Devil .
It &apos;s an old move .
&quot; You don &apos;t like my interpretation ?
Don &apos;t listen , don &apos;t listen !
That &apos;s the Devil speaking . &quot;
Sort of cute .
A very clever little meme .
Thanks very much for your attention .
That &apos;s enough !
Here &apos;s what we do .
You can &apos;t use regular cameras .
The animal does not use that .
Thank you .
And he &apos;s on a mission .
Now , hundreds of homes were destroyed .
And how are we responsible for this ?
Can you see it ?
There we go .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
Thank you .
I am an example of that .
But I was lucky .
I had a scholarship .
I could go to Germany to study .
I was allowed to use even traditional techniques .
It &apos;s not photoshopped .
And the kids , they love it .
I started to build a prototype like that .
Very simple .
I would like to share with you this .
How do you cast mud ?
And sometimes I can leave .
They will do it themselves .
That is it .
Yes , you know it .
I have become myself known .
Merci beaucoup .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Exact equivalent .
As soon as the door closed ...
Couldn &apos;t do it . Could not wait .
Would look at it .
Put it back .
What did they find ?
They were doing fine .
They did not make it to university .
They had bad grades . Some of them dropped out .
A few had good grades .
But she ate it .
But she will be successful .
Thank you so much .
Where are we today ?
In other parts , it doesn &apos;t .
Some of you are familiar with this .
Thank you very much .
Gregory Stock : To upgrade is human
The reason for that is really very simple .
We &apos;re biological creatures .
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot .
Life is short , you know .
And this is very critical stuff .
But who is going to pay for all this ?
It &apos;s too slow .
It &apos;s too risk-averse .
It would change absolutely everything .
Probably not .
Why do you do what you do ?
The third area is reproduction .
The first is cloning .
It didn &apos;t happen .
It &apos;s a total media circus .
Of course there is going to be genetic engineering .
And it &apos;s going to do so for two reasons .
The second is , we &apos;re human .
That &apos;s what we do .
That is simply not going to happen .
It &apos;s not going to happen .
In fact this isn &apos;t just abstract .
It &apos;s the beginning of a new millennium .
And I don &apos;t think that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
You know it &apos;s a little bit like a birth .
Where there is this bloody , awful mess happens .
We &apos;re going to make lots of errors .
It will always be remembered .
We are , definitely .
It &apos;s how we hold it in our hearts .
It &apos;s how we look at it .
Thank you .
So the data on dropping out is amazing .
And this is two kinds .
It &apos;s a social awkwardness .
I &apos;d like to talk about my dad .
My dad has Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
That &apos;s a lot of people .
If the monster wants you , the monster &apos;s gonna get you .
That &apos;s what happened with my dad .
If the monster wants you , the monster &apos;s gonna get you .
And reading is just about impossible .
That all seems like win to me .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
I don &apos;t want to get Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
Thank you .
There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me .
Democracy is the only game in town .
And this is a major issue .
It was the human rights moment .
And it was the birth of the global world .
And you have the Internet .
Now we have the reverse tendency .
And basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
This is probably true .
And the public was extremely all for it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t want to tell you a story .
I want to make a case .
Doesn &apos;t work .
It &apos;s an awesome idea . Doesn &apos;t work .
The key is to overcome what &apos;s called functional fixedness .
It &apos;s a nice motivator .
But that &apos;s not happening here .
Let me show you what I mean .
What happened this time ?
You want to be looking around .
Software can do it faster .
Think about your own work .
Think about your own work .
The rules are mystifying .
Now , I mean it makes me crazy .
And this is not -- here &apos;s the thing .
This is not a feeling .
This is not a philosophy .
Let me give you an example of what I mean .
Standard of living is lower .
What happens ?
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States .
That &apos;s the American experience .
We need a whole new approach .
Okay ? Somebody invented it .
And it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work forever .
Management is great .
Let me give you some examples .
It looks like less than half .
Work on anything you want . &quot;
They show up when they want .
What happens ?
And I say , &quot; Nope . I have proof . &quot;
Different model , right ?
Do it because you like to do it .
If they went head to head , who would win ? &quot;
And here is what science knows .
The drive to do things cause they matter .
And here &apos;s the best part . Here &apos;s the best part .
I rest my case .
You can &apos;t count what you don &apos;t see .
So I was amazed .
Why are you so passionate ? &quot;
So maybe you could interview her . &quot;
And she was just the start .
But think about this .
Most people say women .
Why is that ?
She sells chocolates .
And that &apos;s just to start .
I think that is terrific .
You know why ?
We are the majority .
Thank you very much .
And there &apos;s a cause for that , all right .
It is the landscape , right ?
They &apos;re perfect .
Okay , I wrote that .
No , no , I didn &apos;t write that .
Like that , and like this .
And so forth .
Okay ?
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m past that . We &apos;re not going to go into that .
I am multitudes .
And once again , this is , for me , interesting .
Let &apos;s watch just another clip .
This , in fact , is not the title of this piece .
Let &apos;s continue with that same excerpt .
The important question is , &quot; Is it interesting ? &quot;
And with that , I thank you very much .
There was no money involved .
Human beings needed the light .
They needed the light to see .
I start with the notion of the ideograph .
What is the abstraction ?
And you see the mechanics .
You don &apos;t question that .
You took pieces of sticks .
That &apos;s what moves you .
Miranda : Do you love me ?
Ferdinand : Beyond all limit .
Looking for business , governor ?
Prospera : Caliban !
Caliban : This island is mine .
Sebastian : Draw thy sword .
JT : Okay .
It becomes something magically large .
It becomes the rainstorm .
Spider Man is not bound by gravity .
Bono : They &apos;re mythologies .
They &apos;re modern myths , these comic book heroes .
Circus , rock &apos; n &apos; roll , drama .
And no hiking boots .
I know you &apos;ve all been there .
It &apos;s my trial by fire .
I know you understand that .
Thank you .
Not so much .
You had to survive .
She has an issue with authority .
She &apos;s not going to go anywhere . &quot;
We wanted those freedoms .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t speak English .
So , I did it .
I didn &apos;t succeed .
It has also chimpanzees .
That is a forest giraffe .
Who have been doing that ?
Young children . Child soldiers .
And that was the language of the war .
And after that , we succeeded .
So , it was so bad .
And there was no way to work .
They destroy everything .
Poaching -- oh , no way .
And they can &apos;t do what they are doing .
So we went to meet them .
We don &apos;t think so .
And we continued .
Something might be going on .
Sorry .
I said , &quot; I have never seen it .
I don &apos;t know . &quot;
So I was scared .
And I was mad .
And I succeeded .
Where are you people ?
See what the wars in Rwanda .
That &apos;s because of the language of guns .
Thank you .
Just wait over there .
I think that now I feel nervous .
I did it myself .
And they can &apos;t go even to university .
There was no separation of sexes .
They were together while praying .
Quite ironic .
It &apos;s something terrible , horrible .
It was there for thousands of years .
The context has changed .
That &apos;s one thing to remember .
Thanks so much .
And the way Clayton put it was this way .
We all have children .
We are all cut from the same genetic cloth .
The cause of suffering is ignorance .
But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below ?
And where does the river rise ?
They call themselves the Elder Brothers .
This does not have to happen .
Thank you very much .
Not very many of you .
So a couple .
That &apos;s okay .
So meet Romo .
Thanks , little guy .
Bless you .
So here &apos;s the iPad .
So I &apos;ll snap a picture .
Okay . Awesome .
Here you go .
Thank you , Scott .
Thanks , Scott .
Thank you .
How many children will you get ?
How are you going to scale ?
How are you going to replicate ? &quot;
It was very difficult not to get scared , not to get daunted .
But how wrong it is .
That &apos;s absolute hogwash .
The children have taught them .
I mingled with almost everyone .
They were very friendly .
They are really excelling .
He &apos;s in kindergarten .
I like eating . I like playing . &quot;
Thank you .
And the first thing is passion .
I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d make it . &quot;
And so I began to think about that .
What are the dimensions of this machine ?
So it &apos;s a very big number .
So let me go through those three things .
And so in some ways , all you really need is a cloudbook .
It &apos;s wireless . It &apos;s always connected .
So the machine is computing .
And everything will go through the Web .
They &apos;re going to speak the Web language .
The media wants to be liquid .
Attention is the currency .
And that &apos;s what we called the Net ; that was the Internet of nets .
And what we &apos;re sharing were links , so you had to be kind of open with links .
So that &apos;s what we were doing .
So I &apos;ll give you one kind of an example .
But what &apos;s it &apos;s doing is sharing data .
It &apos;s always going to be there , and the closer it is , the better .
That is going to be the price .
Secondly , it &apos;s become much more personalized .
It &apos;s going to be machine-readable .
You want to make something that the machine can read .
I appreciate your time .
I have to serve . &quot;
They work in the field .
They have education programs .
This is in the Scottish Parliament .
This can happen .
Isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
Thank you very much .
The cat likes this version better .
That &apos;s quantum mechanics .
Most of us are familiar with electrons .
That &apos;s a lot of particles to keep track of .
This is what we know for certain .
Now how bad would that be ?
Well , pretty bad .
And this is another , and another .
Thank you very much .
Is it bigger ? Is it smaller ?
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
My subject today is learning .
Ready ?
Now I &apos;m a science reporter .
I write books and magazine articles .
And I &apos;m also a mother .
It &apos;s also tastes and smells .
And often it does something more .
The specter of mass starvation loomed .
Here &apos;s another story .
Let me be clear .
Thank you .
This is what he had to say .
My love ...
There &apos;s only you in my life ...
The only thing that &apos;s bright ...
My first love ...
You &apos;re every breath that I take ...
You &apos;re every step I make ...
And I ....
I want to share all my love with you ...
No one else will do ...
And your eyes ...
They tell me how much you care ...
So , this is remix , right ?
It &apos;s the point about how this connects to our kids .
We can only drive it underground .
Thank you very much .
&quot; Do you have tenure ? &quot;
Let me start with the arts .
Well , here &apos;s a diagnosis .
And here &apos;s just one example .
Thank you very much .
He was a great storyteller .
I really , really wanted to go to the Arctic .
I love the place .
Fresh water freezes at zero .
It &apos;s fucking freezing .
It couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end .
So we stopped the ship , as you do .
I climbed out of the ice .
We are going to actually have to take them off . &quot;
There were open patches of sea everywhere .
Just scuttle forward and go for it . &quot;
It was absolutely magical .
Take the shoes . Take the shoes .
Thank you so much .
Audience : Encore !
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very , very much .
What would happen then ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Dan , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
None of those happened .
Where was this guilt trip coming from ? &quot;
Right , that &apos;s what he seems like .
So I looked carefully at this guy .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
But this was not the case .
Like this .
We built the hardware and the software .
Oh , my God .
What ?
Thank you .
So , let &apos;s look at the proof .
The first question is this .
Our country has two exploration programs .
Why are people afraid of the ocean ?
Mostly discoveries made by accident .
I have a characterization .
It gives you the false impression it &apos;s a map .
It is not a map .
This is on a Mercator projection .
Tens of thousands of active volcanoes .
It was hot . It wasn &apos;t hot enough .
Finding the state of preservation .
The Okeanos Explorer on its mission .
We can disseminate .
And the technology is at hand .
Thank you very much .
Thank you for being here .
That &apos;s a big thing in California .
I called my parents up .
They &apos;re back in Philadelphia .
Mothers are like that .
And so I did .
Well , that just ended communication .
I didn &apos;t .
It &apos;s only 500 miles .
I had a newspaper clipping .
You don &apos;t … ?
And they said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot;
You &apos;re going to go to South America , aren &apos;t you ? &quot;
So I did that .
They had to take that class with me .
&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
My dad came out again .
Well , I put on my backpack again .
&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
And so that &apos;s the message that I had .
And I looked at him and I said , &quot; Passport , huh ?
I didn &apos;t get shot .
Now how could that be ?
You know , we can do it .
I was going to have to change .
But I know I needed to .
Thank you .
It &apos;s understanding data .
Thank you very much .
Vinay Venkatraman : Technology crafts for the digitally underserved
That &apos;s what we &apos;re after .
So this man , his name is Sathi Shri .
&quot; Yes . &quot;
It &apos;s actually happening in all parts of the country .
You &apos;ve got to try it on your own to believe it .
They &apos;re not something that &apos;s been established .
It &apos;s not something that &apos;s institutionalized .
Come along .
Vinay Venkatraman : Yeah . That &apos;s right . Okay .
So ...
Let &apos;s see what happens here .
Great . Good news .
VV : So ...
Thank you .
Gustavo Dudamel !
&quot; Danzon No. 2 . &quot;
It &apos;s the idea of computation .
Very simple .
Try changing it again .
So here it is .
So let &apos;s give it a try .
Hope for the best .
Very good . Okay .
So far so good .
And it should be able to tell us that .
let &apos;s say the revenue of Microsoft .
So let &apos;s say we have a lab finding that ...
But that &apos;s just the beginning .
So , I &apos;m pretty pleased with it all .
Let me show you a couple of examples here .
I think it &apos;s actually rather wonderful .
Let &apos;s try this here .
Okay . Let &apos;s zoom out again .
One &apos;s got to build a lot of technology .
Thank you .
Stay here . I &apos;ve got a question .
Does your work relate to his ?
SW : I think so .
Stephen Wolfram , thank you .
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
It seemed so intuitive to me .
One more mind will be unlocked .
Thank you .
Just think for a moment .
Now plants are under threat .
I think it does .
And those are the dry land species .
And we &apos;re almost there .
Thank you very much .
That stuff &apos;s cool . &quot;
Walked into the Lego store .
Bought him this .
Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control .
You walk there , and it hurts .
Torture , very funny .
Wow , you guys are great .
I was like , &quot; Yeah .
I suppose we are . &quot;
Whatever .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; Holy shit !
Just beautiful .
I &apos;m coming out .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing actually .
Okay . Anyway .
The insides were Lego .
This is my house .
And this is my house .
Anyway , I &apos;m out of time .
Let &apos;s see here .
Okay .
Ta-da .
They &apos;re psychiatrists .
It &apos;s certainly not complete .
They are in the birthing rooms .
Bill Gates agrees .
Today , not so much .
It is happening .
It will happen .
Thank you .
I was hanging on to have a pee .
So , the water bottle .
It &apos;s my impression of water .
I use , now , a whole new process .
It makes the product strong , the tessellation .
It &apos;s a millefiori of ideas .
How do you condense that ?
It comes back to instinct .
It &apos;s organic and it &apos;s essential .
I make organic things which are essential .
What a waste . Anyway .
Cars are all wrong .
Forget that . We move on .
I &apos;m trying to build transportation systems .
It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this .
This is a shot in the studio .
Who cares ?
It &apos;s made from Kevlar .
These are my sculptures .
A copper jelly mold .
So , it &apos;s going to end .
Thank you very much .
What might they find ?
This is no hypothetical question .
Here &apos;s an example of one of these objects .
Well obviously this is a replica .
But who is this person ?
A king ? A god ?
A priest ?
We don &apos;t know .
So how big do you think that is ?
Perhaps that big ?
Or maybe that big ?
Well let me show you .
So what were these used for ?
And why was I fascinated ?
Are you ready ?
Okay . Left to right ?
Oh , it &apos;s almost 50 / 50 . Okay .
And so they had to cram the sign .
Languages contain patterns .
Here are some examples .
Here &apos;s an example of one such text .
What about the Indus script ?
Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range .
Now what about the Indus script ?
What does this result really show ?
Why is that the case ?
So as an example , here &apos;s a word .
Can you write it using pictures ?
I &apos;ll give you a couple seconds .
Got it ?
Okay . Great .
Here &apos;s my solution .
There could be other solutions .
Here &apos;s a really short text .
So that was pretty exciting .
It looks like we &apos;re getting somewhere .
Well not yet .
Why should we care ?
Thank you .
And here &apos;s a prime example .
Sleep deprivation is extreme .
I had tears rolling down my cheeks .
It &apos;s simply not sustainable .
I felt I was not talented at anything .
A bit better .
I found my passion .
And I won .
I felt I was not alive anymore .
I will show it to you .
It &apos;s not really true .
Now , this is a totally insane idea .
Because there &apos;s a lot of money in sandalwoods .
So it &apos;s a joke against myself .
Thank you very much .
But that &apos;s not the hard part . &quot;
Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent .
Thank you .
So my name is Taylor Wilson .
That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor .
Well it doesn &apos;t break even .
So maybe I don &apos;t want to admit to that .
So thank you very much .
He needed them -- he needed the money for starting a company .
And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt .
What &apos;s the population of the Earth ?
We &apos;re in charge . It &apos;s frightening .
Let &apos;s have the next video .
Okay , this one will be a left turn .
Here , but -- -- anyway .
And that &apos;s it , yeah , just a few inventions .
All right .
Well , it doesn &apos;t have to be terrible .
And maybe ...
The person &apos;s just , if you will , pushing on the screen to make a curve .
We are so used to doing monologues .
This is relatively important because it sets the page ...
And the child said , &quot; No , I can &apos;t . &quot;
How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
Or I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
But then I started feeling bad .
So then I started feeling bad .
So see , here &apos;s the thing .
So let me explain how this works .
You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
So for example , Ticketmaster .
So funny things can happen .
It &apos;s the word &quot; Christians &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
So we get this .
Oops .
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
That &apos;s how it works .
Some of them are very cute .
Some of them are funnier .
Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
So I posed the question to my graduate student .
First of all , translating the Web .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
It makes a lot of mistakes .
Actually it was a forum post .
It was translated from Japanese into English .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
So he &apos;s just explaining something .
So back to the question .
We could do that .
Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
So it would be very expensive .
That &apos;s a big problem .
There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
The top is the German .
You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
That &apos;s the current business model .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
So here &apos;s the site .
So thank you .
Steven Strogatz : The science of sync
It &apos;s interesting .
They &apos;re choreographing themselves .
There are just three simple rules .
Yes , it &apos;s happening here .
There doesn &apos;t seem to be anything mystical about this .
How do the rules give rise to the patterns ?
On , more on and then off .
No one believed them .
Hold your breath for me .
What I have here are two empty water bottles .
I have some metronomes here .
Can you hear that ?
Right ? They did .
How can metronomes communicate ?
Let &apos;s see if we can get this to work .
Boy : About the second one .
Think of the people as being like metronomes .
And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge .
Engineer : I felt I was disappointed about it .
This was to be the focus of the investigation .
Interviewer : It &apos;s actually quite difficult to walk .
I learned so much from her .
For three hours this went on .
It &apos;s called the Dunning – Kruger effect .
Thank you .
Well , we know a few things .
Now , dolphins are natural acousticians .
And they have touch .
This is the dolphin &apos;s sonar .
There &apos;s a bubble .
Now , these are three spectragrams .
So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin .
She &apos;s kind of teasing him and taunting him .
And these are artificially created whistles .
Now this is video of a session .
So this is only once .
So I try to give her the scarf .
Whoop . Almost lost it .
The dolphin &apos;s at the keyboard .
It &apos;s designed to really be two-way .
Thank you .
And this influenced me .
This is a hospital building .
This is a shop for a bag company .
This is studios for artists .
And this is a window display .
But they aren &apos;t in London .
And so you &apos;re stuck on a bus .
And this is a project for a bridge .
And so this is in Paddington in London .
It &apos;s just steel and timber .
So that &apos;s it speeded up .
And it &apos;s a power park .
There &apos;s 250 pavilions .
And the same with flowers .
Voice Over : The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop .
And I just wanted to show you .
Children : One , two , three , go .
So finally , texture is something .
So we &apos;re building these buildings .
They &apos;re just chopped at different heights .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So there were 66,000 of these .
This optic was 22 feet long .
Thank you , Thomas .
Right ?
A few , but not most .
Here &apos;s Andy &apos;s theory .
Why the Greeks ?
It &apos;s a little like your reputation .
Lesson number three : Atalanta .
Thank you .
How did he learn them ?
Here &apos;s a clue .
It felt like a revolution .
What is going on here ?
And third , you need desire .
We are learning from them .
The wheel is turning .
Okay , step back a minute .
We &apos;re a social species .
We spark off each other .
I don &apos;t think it will be .
Video is high-bandwidth for a reason .
He &apos;s a unicyclist .
But look at this video .
It &apos;s actually faster to read than to view .
It &apos;s right here .
Print scaled .
that just went global .
Now , this is big .
Schools can &apos;t be silos .
That changes everything , right ?
Who &apos;s the teacher ?
You &apos;re the teacher .
There &apos;s a self-help group .
You know what ?
Thank you .
And thank you .
He lived in a fairly wealthy home .
So he had traveled all around .
You just have to look at your skin .
You , you can teach it .
You can touch it .
You can understand it .
Take it out of this room .
Spread the word .
Understand it . Appreciate it . Celebrate it .
You are the products of evolution .
Thank you .
But , of course , that &apos;s the point .
And immediately a voice shouted , &quot; Kangaroo ! &quot;
&quot; No , no , no ! Should be a frog ! &quot;
Interesting .
You don &apos;t look disabled . &quot;
What is a sexy body ?
Nobody calls her disabled .
Poetry matters .
Heavy !
So whimsy matters .
Today , I &apos;m 6 &apos; 1 &quot; .
And I was having fun with it .
It &apos;s a conversation about augmentation .
It &apos;s a conversation about potential .
Thank you .
You see , we also have the technology .
I say , less and less the human touch .
And it didn &apos;t work , didn &apos;t work .
And then he told her , get up .
&quot; The next morning she was dead .
&quot; OK . OK ? OK . OK .
And this is called &quot; Toughness . &quot;
I think that &apos;s good luck .
She said , &apos; Look who she is .
&quot; Freedom ? It would have to be the rodeo .
Thank you .
And I believe this is going to prove true .
See again , the diversity .
This is scrolling up the East coast .
This is visualizing international communications .
Some of you may recognize this .
I was probably being a little extreme .
And I started collecting sheep .
Lots of sheep .
Kind of amazing what some people did .
Which I was pretty surprised by .
He draws sheep after sheep .
And I like that .
But here there was no sheep-like criteria .
That &apos;s all I &apos;m getting paid for this ?
You may recognize these two guys .
This is what that sounded like .
I &apos;m sorry for this .
So we did exactly that .
Again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
But there &apos;s a bunch of different styles .
And this is called &quot; The Wilderness Downtown . &quot;
Thanks a lot .
It &apos;s called the liquid metal battery .
The science is that simple .
I &apos;m talking about the production of aluminum .
And I did .
And that includes our own bodies .
Magnesium for the top layer .
And antimony for the bottom layer .
And then we reverse the current .
But does it really work ?
We go to the laboratory .
I called it the shotglass .
I call it the hockey puck .
And we got the same remarkable results .
We call that the pizza .
It &apos;s going to be 36 inches in diameter .
They lie beyond the visible .
Avoid thermal runaway .
It &apos;s a mess . It &apos;s all over the place .
This was an enormous revelation .
That &apos;s called &quot; adherence . &quot;
And then he analyzed the data .
Now why is that important ?
It &apos;s a mystery !
Takes over the mustard business !
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy .
What do I mean by that ?
This is the way it ought to be .
But that changed , right ?
And the example he used was coffee .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Have you come across this idea ?
And it &apos;s working beautifully .
Class sizes are smaller than in many countries .
Okay . Or grandchildren .
How about two children or more ? Right .
Small people wandering about .
Children are natural learners .
Teaching is a word like that .
I mean , you may have a dog .
He says , &quot; No , I &apos;m fine .
Why would you drop out ?
They have certain common features .
They &apos;re very personalized .
And they work .
You know ?
Nothing grows there because it doesn &apos;t rain .
Hence , Death Valley .
It &apos;s dormant .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
It was a Palm Pilot .
And it actually worked great .
So what do I mean by that ?
And that &apos;s exactly what we did .
Unbelievable improvements in efficiency .
Thank you .
Let me give you one example of this .
Has anybody stayed there ?
It &apos;s the lift , it &apos;s a series of buttons in the lift .
I said , &quot; It &apos;s really , really easy . &quot;
Okay , you simply wouldn &apos;t .
And I &apos;d be wrong to dis that completely .
That &apos;s called trivia .
We don &apos;t know what to call it .
Thank you very much .
This is a public budget .
Thank you .
It was just frightening .
KB : Thanks for letting me show these .
They freak out .
Of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
Transparency can be misdirected .
It makes sense , right ?
Ten minutes ?
Five minutes ?
One minute ?
How about 15 seconds ?
Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden .
They &apos;re happy . They are satisfied .
We get free content .
Thank you .
The marathon grew .
Thank you .
Stereotypes have been broken .
It is more of a marathon .
Thank you .
So , let &apos;s start off in China .
This photo was taken two weeks ago .
But this is Tiananmen Square .
He was delighted .
She went to high school .
She went to vocational school for accounting .
She sent money back to her family .
In the 19th century , it was slavery .
She &apos;s exaggerating . &quot;
Hands up , please .
Okay , most of you .
And , you know , it happens for several reasons .
Poverty , for instance .
There are three reasons why this is the case .
You need to use scarce resources .
Do you think we &apos;ll make it ? &quot;
So here is Bill of Arabia .
And I &apos;ll just say two things about this .
She lives in Ethiopia .
She was married against her will at age 13 .
In a word , she stank .
And at the time , she was miserable .
Saima &apos;s not going to produce you a son . &quot;
This is when she had her second daughter .
So now they &apos;re in it together .
They sold the milk for cash .
No matter , she was just delighted to be in school .
There &apos;s a book called &quot; Dead Aid . &quot;
He sort of mumbled .
I will just leave you with two things .
She never broke down .
What that was was a bird feeder .
So , here &apos;s the cause .
Join the movement .
Thank you very much .
So let me ask for a show of hands .
Well , there do seem to be a few .
Now , that &apos;s the good news .
Only about 250 .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not .
Well , what is it to make a therapeutic , anyway ?
That picture you see there ?
That &apos;s the good news .
How do we go faster ?
Well , that &apos;s exciting .
Sam , please have a seat .
So let me sum up .
Thank you all very much .
I started my own experiments .
Thank you !
Thank you !
So I go on television .
It &apos;s totally almost just like that .
And that &apos;s just on air .
Let me give you a small example .
I care about two things .
You &apos;d totally be surprised .
Conservatives are really nice .
That is emotional correctness .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
Thank you .
Unfortunately I couldn &apos;t go .
They make balloon animals .
But what do we do for a living ?
And everyone said it was impossible .
It is a moment in time .
I have a better mousetrap .
But be careful .
I call it the idea of tribes .
He did it by creating a movement .
You don &apos;t need everyone .
We need to organize around it . &quot;
It &apos;s exactly the same behavior though .
It &apos;s tens of thousands of pairs of shoes .
They want to be missed .
Thank you very much . I appreciate it .
It &apos;s really a time machine .
Thank you .
And it was snowing that day .
So when I was born , I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me .
And that &apos;s a belief that I share .
So what &apos;s going to solve this ?
Well the answer isn &apos;t going to be more of the same .
Thank you .
I ran away .
And here it is : it &apos;s called the Green School .
The classrooms have no walls .
The desks are not square .
And we practice holism .
Would he have had more possibilities in his life ?
The classrooms have natural light .
They &apos;re beautiful . They &apos;re bamboo .
The breeze passes through them .
And you know what these are .
There &apos;s nowhere to flush .
How many people times how much water .
There isn &apos;t enough water .
Not many things didn &apos;t work .
I asked him , &quot; Why ? &quot;
This was a great thing .
It &apos;s becoming a community .
We had to look at everything .
No pavement .
There are no sidewalks .
This is the school buffalo .
Landscaping .
You learn bamboo building .
The kids love it .
And we were right .
And how did we do all this ?
On giant grass .
It &apos;s bamboo .
It &apos;s a double helix .
It was chaos .
We believe it is .
So , Mr. Gore , thank you .
Thank you .
That &apos;s what brings the monsoon rain .
And the whole system goes into reverse .
Keep that in mind .
They need fresh water to breed .
They lay the eggs into fresh water .
So , they &apos;re very important .
But this guy is an exception .
Didn &apos;t notice them .
And again I didn &apos;t think too much of it .
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks .
The trees can put their roots into it .
Humans can dig holes and make a well .
But dragonflies -- a bit tricky .
There is no surface fresh water .
And I got a bit curious about it .
Seemed a bit unlikely .
Then Malé , then further south .
How on Earth are they doing that ?
I didn &apos;t know .
What on Earth are they doing ?
They &apos;re making it all the way across to East Africa .
They &apos;re up , and they &apos;re off .
They hatched out in India .
This is a summer monsoon .
There is more to the story .
But it &apos;s also called the Amur Falcon .
So , Siberia , Manchuria .
And that &apos;s where it breeds .
It &apos;s , well , you can imagine .
No , they turn across here .
It comes with the monsoons .
They make use of exactly the same winds .
Same height as the dragonflies go .
It &apos;s a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater .
Good afternoon .
Many things have been said about this .
It so happens that these weapons are dangerous .
This issue isn &apos;t just theoretical .
Estonia accused Russia .
Thank you .
Who has an Android phone ?
Who has a Blackberry ?
You don &apos;t have to put your hands up .
These are rhetorical .
Actually , it isn &apos;t .
What it is is a map of innovation .
So where it &apos;s happening is in Africa .
It &apos;s built on gold .
I believe we are the gold .
This is innovation over the edge .
So there &apos;s only one thing left to say .
&#91; &quot; You &apos;re welcome &quot; &#93;
Respectable people kept slaves .
Reason has muscle .
Who shall be judge ?
The partners are both willing .
SP : The possession of nuclear weapons .
RNG : Eh , I &apos;m not holding my breath .
So there &apos;s good news .
And I will take Kenya as an example .
Here you see the data .
What is the origin of the data ?
How many children did you have ?
Are they alive ?
But they have good quality .
So this is a limitation .
And when the experts in the U.N.
It was so tragic .
I was so happy .
This was the estimate of the new survey .
So we celebrated .
They say , &quot; 0.9 percent , no progress . &quot;
That &apos;s unfair .
They have 2.4 percent .
The HIV epidemic peaked .
We got , later , the mosquito netting .
Here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
My ancestors moved to the United States .
But you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
Here we have a problem .
And the size of the bubble is the population .
What has happened ?
Huh ?
They have here Singapore .
They have here Qatar .
This is crap .
Thank you very much .
So case closed , right ?
Wrong .
And this can take quite a while .
with no employees .
But they settled .
No counter offer .
Now how did that happen ?
It came back signed .
Patents are very difficult to overturn .
Don &apos;t forget that .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to start here .
And it &apos;s a copyright violation .
It &apos;s from the Senate .
They want to take them out of the domain name system .
That was the level of rhetoric .
And Congress did something .
So they went for plan B.
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve found .
That &apos;s the easy thing .
That &apos;s the simple thing .
That &apos;s the way to handle this .
Thank you .
This troubles me .
Well , I think that I can do something .
And my feeling is -- Thank you .
The results have been fantastic .
I &apos;ll just give you a few examples .
That &apos;s Duke !
The best I can imagine .
They were very enthusiastic .
Thank you very much .
Hillary &apos;s completely gone .
This is what we found in our reporting . &quot;
We try to give a good picture of reality .
I disagree with that .
She had been a bright , easygoing girl .
Eyes up here .
Pam from The Office .
Manga girls .
Here &apos;s my problem with that argument .
It &apos;s called agenda-setting .
But he did have one suggestion .
It &apos;s for the Guardian newspaper .
And I don &apos;t even have any help . &quot;
But the truth is I was devastated .
These things are ours .
They will be used for our purposes .
Do you have safe housing ? &quot;
You need more .
And what do they do when they &apos;re there ?
Health just takes more time .
Now in the top 10 cities in the U.S.
Do they have transportation to the pharmacy ?
Do they have food to take with the prescription ?
Do they have insurance to fill the prescription ?
You must pursue that vision . &quot;
And I have to say , I was like &quot; Whoa .
That &apos;s a lot of pressure . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
It was dreaming time .
But here I am .
No , no , no .
One , two , three , four , five , six and seven .
Six years old .
Two years later , one -- zoop .
But I could not understand .
And he was frowning .
He said , &quot; Philippe , you have been had .
And the next day one rope off .
But nobody wanted to hire me .
I step over the beam .
But it is too late .
The wire is ready .
You know that , right ?
Thank you . Thank you .
Now comes the day of the walk .
But he seemed nervous .
I stop in the middle .
I make the dove appear .
People applaud in delight .
And people scream .
You laugh , you laugh . But hey .
What a genius , what a professional .
So I take a bow . I salute with my hand .
And the entire valley goes crazy .
And something happened .
Inspiration .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
I &apos;d like to begin with four questions .
Would you be able to do that ?
That &apos;s what plants actually do for a living .
I promise you that most of you will have got that .
Right ? That would explain it , right ?
It &apos;s a plan , looking down from above .
So you &apos;ve -- it &apos;s crap , isn &apos;t it really ? As we say .
So , children are not empty vessels , OK ?
Thank you very much .
Now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
And this is truly astonishing .
Welcome to Doha .
And you can see that life expectancy was also short .
Someone says , &quot; How so ? How could this happen ? &quot;
People started to get to know each other .
Let &apos;s look at today .
So what &apos;s the population today ?
It &apos;s 1.7 million people .
And this is amongst the highest worldwide .
The question is how .
We have no water whatsoever .
That is our river .
So what are the risks ?
Do you worry much ?
There &apos;s also changing diets .
So we also face risks .
Indeed there is .
Let &apos;s start with the water .
And that is a lot of water .
Thank you very much .
There are now a couple of hundred thousand .
He &apos;s over there .
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do .
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five .
He certainly doesn &apos;t look like me .
He looks like this .
Perhaps something very naughty .
Compassion is something that creates happiness .
But fun is not enough .
That would create the conditions for world peace .
It &apos;s sort of a funny pattern .
And let me give you some examples .
So what do they do ?
But again , fun is not enough .
So what are they ?
What does that mean ?
That &apos;s one .
The second ingredient is autonomy .
So in Google , there &apos;s a lot of autonomy .
What a company .
It works in three steps .
The first step is attention training .
The second step follows the first step .
What does that mean ?
I want you to be happy . &quot;
Thank you .
Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth .
Linear : take , make , waste .
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .
We call it Cool Carpet .
It is practical , and pretty too .
I don &apos;t think so .
Who is that person ?
Not you . Not I.
Begin , I will .
Thank you .
So he &apos;s got memory .
The memory is this bit over here .
You see it all like this .
Of course , it &apos;s this big .
And there &apos;s not just one of these , there &apos;s many of them .
Now , he needed accessories .
You need accessories you &apos;re going to come with .
It &apos;s completely mechanical , again , a printer .
You also need graphics , right ?
Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics .
This is called the Church – Turing thesis .
You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to .
So there are plans .
The project has a number of parts to it .
So , give me five years .
Thank you very much .
In addition , it &apos;s multi-spectral .
Extract geometry from the images .
We think about the user interface .
I thank you very much for your time .
Children don &apos;t like it .
It &apos;s why they leave lights on around the house .
Adults find it comforting .
That &apos;s the end of that .
That &apos;s the end .
That &apos;s the end .
Allan Jones : A map of the brain
So let &apos;s take a look at the brain .
This is the blood vessels .
Let &apos;s look at neurons .
These are proteins .
And remember , it &apos;s frozen .
And then the laser actually cuts .
It &apos;s involved in learning and memory .
Proteins are targets for drugs .
And we get confirmation .
Thanks .
It wouldn &apos;t happen .
So I started to get intrigued .
But shipping isn &apos;t that .
And it was a revelation .
They don &apos;t have time to relax .
Now how is that possible ?
And that was a surprise to me .
But why has it taken so long ?
Thank you .
Thank you .
I come from Colorado .
Mine was 146 .
I didn &apos;t .
I wanted to live .
He said , &quot; Be happy .
And it was right-heart failure .
And they had lungs .
It was a match .
They were from Texas .
An infection ravaged my skin .
I was 95 lbs .
It &apos;s about living .
&#91; Singing : French &#93; Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Thank you .
This is Europa .
You need a melt probe .
What then of manned space exploration ?
Go , go , go .
It &apos;s not going to look like that .
We can &apos;t do that right now .
We have to beat that .
We can go much further .
There &apos;s another thing .
You got two choices .
It has never been done .
That &apos;s not true .
Thank you .
Do you know that surgery ?
Just two things .
That is what free gets you .
18 more months .
Oh yeah .
&quot; After you . &quot; &quot; Oh , no , no . After you . &quot;
&quot; Great ! Excellent ! &quot;
Well , they signed me up immediately .
I worked alone .
Two reasons .
But it wasn &apos;t just individuals .
As have this guy &apos;s .
Thanks .
It &apos;s totally intimidating .
So , thank you very much , Evan . EW : Thank you .
That was very interesting .
Blocks have names .
There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot;
Domo arigato gozaimashita .
Good morning everybody .
Why do I do this ?
What does that even mean ?
Well , heart cells are pretty greedy .
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner .
Thank you .
Paul Gilding : The Earth is full
Come on , you &apos;re thinking .
That &apos;s not possible .
That &apos;s all true .
We need it to develop technology .
We need it to keep social stability .
It certainly is .
And that &apos;s what will happen to us .
I actually don &apos;t say this in despair .
I accept where we are .
When does this breakdown begin ?
I want to talk to you about fear .
The crisis is now inevitable .
The future is inherently uncertain .
Perhaps denial .
Perhaps anger .
Maybe fear .
Think about war .
And this is where you come in .
We can do this .
They &apos;re wrong .
Thank you .
Markus Fischer : A robot that flies like a bird
Birds are very agile .
So be careful later on .
So why do we do all this ?
Thank you .
We have a wingspan of about two meters .
We have a split wing .
Thank you .
Markus Fischer : Yeah , sure .
I just really want to thank you very much .
I &apos;ll explain at another time .
I hope , I believe .
Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints .
And that really , really excites me .
Political , economic , psychological , whatever .
And that &apos;s actually what I &apos;d like to talk about today .
Don &apos;t ask .
Beautiful , royal people .
Well , I turned him down .
The right to live like a human .
The right to live , period .
Because this is not all about charity .
This is about justice . Really .
That &apos;s right .
We like to give , and we give a lot .
It questions our commitment .
Africa is a continent in flames .
Funny , that .
And let &apos;s cut the crap for a second .
The regional branch managers are getting nervous .
Our credibility ?
Brand USA could use some polishing .
But think about it .
Well , much more than we think .
It is not a theory .
Look at the Gates Foundation .
This is what excites me .
It &apos;s a fact .
It is a pain in the arse .
Do we have the will ?
I do not have flowers in my hair .
Actually , I come from punk rock .
But I know toughness when I see it .
We &apos;re calling it the ONE Campaign .
Well , we feel that now is the time to prove we &apos;re right .
We believe this is one .
Momentum has been building .
Lurching a little , but it &apos;s building .
They started out with such promise on Africa .
But some of them they haven &apos;t .
I understand that .
That &apos;s really what I would like you to do .
Give us that kind of dreaming , that kind of doing .
There &apos;s the continent Africa .
But there &apos;s also our sense of ourselves .
People are starting to figure this out .
Movements are springing up .
Really , it &apos;s just three things this whole age will be remembered for .
The digital revolution , yes .
The war against terror , yes .
Thank you , thank you very much .
Okay , my three wishes .
Anyway , here &apos;s number one .
That is my first wish .
I believe it &apos;s possible .
You know , there &apos;s lots out there .
We just need your help in making it happen .
We will have the ear of Congress .
Right , my second wish , number two .
That &apos;s one billion media hits .
The problem is enormous .
Every three seconds one person dies .
Another three seconds , one more .
Please join us by working together .
We can make history .
Please visit ONE at this address .
I think it &apos;s possible .
Since then , not that much has changed .
Thank you very much once again .
Cities are the crucible of civilization .
Here &apos;s some numbers .
It &apos;s now more than 82 percent .
This is going to affect everything .
That &apos;s the question .
That &apos;s the quest .
Is that conceivable ?
Are there universal laws ?
Is London a great big whale ?
Is Edinburgh a horse ?
Very few cities fail .
Well we understand this very well .
We &apos;re going to discuss that in a moment more .
That &apos;s called growth .
Here &apos;s how you grew .
We &apos;re all pretty much the same .
This is just the weight versus the age .
And you see , it stops growing .
This is what we believe .
Okay , so how do we understand this ?
And here &apos;s the point of that .
There is an extraordinary regularity .
And the reason for this is because of networks .
Here &apos;s just a symbolic picture of that .
And here &apos;s scaling of cities .
The slope of that is less than linear .
There is an economy of scale .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
And you can see , they all follow the same line .
And here &apos;s the statement .
What is the reason for this ?
So there it is , I &apos;ve said it again .
On the left is the heart rate showing biology .
Lastly , I want to talk about growth .
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis .
See companies , they scale .
The top one , in fact , is Walmart on the right .
It &apos;s the same plot .
Thank you .
So , tissue design .
Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics .
So , the more the merrier .
Mapping and tagging .
They &apos;re still very useful .
Thank you very much .
The ballot boxes go to counting places .
And the secret is the ballot form .
Thank you .
But how to make it happen ?
&quot; Why don &apos;t you try ? &quot;
The engine is the spinal cord .
This was amazing .
Clearly , the steering system was missing .
Imagine , this is really cool .
We were so frustrated .
In fact -- Thank you .
I mean , how is it possible ?
And me ?
Thank you .
There is a real problem with snobbery .
That is snobbery .
We &apos;ve done away with the caste system .
And it &apos;s a beautiful idea .
She &apos;s simply too strange .
She comes from an odd place .
And yet , they &apos;re not .
Which makes for a very -- can make for a very stressful situation .
I think there is . I just want to turn to a few of them .
Let &apos;s take meritocracy .
I am a meritocrat in that sense .
It &apos;s not the post that should count .
But something very valuable in that idea , nevertheless .
That is an unknown part of them .
There is another source of solace and comfort for all this .
They &apos;ve passed the wrong piece of legislation . Whatever it is .
Now is there any alternative to this ?
And then my favorite .
They really do have a kind of genius all of their own , these guys .
And so we tend to worship ourselves .
Our heroes are human heroes .
That &apos;s a very new situation .
Here &apos;s an insight that I &apos;ve had about success .
We are highly open to suggestion .
Thank you very much .
Or do you think that you can &apos;t ?
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
Alain de Botton .
Thank you very much .
Instead , hit the space bar .
Just hit the space bar twice .
Here &apos;s something that drives me crazy .
I &apos;m not bitter .
It neatly selects just that word .
Just type over it .
You get it every time .
In the meantime , congratulations .
Have a great day .
This is the Africa of opportunity .
That is that people talk about corruption , corruption .
I want to tell you that .
So the market is there .
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent .
For 10,000 pieces .
Thank you very much .
Do you hate Americans ?
We don &apos;t have to reinvent the wheel .
We don &apos;t have to go back to that .
Thank you .
So I do it .
So actually , check this out .
Very embarrassing .
You know , homosexuality , right ?
Yeah , exactly .
It &apos;s just that .
Hi there .
Rosie O &apos;Donnell : Hello , Ben .
Her grandmother says , &quot; Delish ! &quot;
I want to stay out of the way .
Do you get nervous , Ashleigh ?
Ashleigh : Doing what ?
ROD : Cutting hair .
ROD : You like it ? All right .
ROD : No , not me , no .
IM : It looks good , yeah ?
IM : Oh , it &apos;s so fabulous !
ROD : Flock of Rosie . Wooo !
Everything boils down to that .
So check this out .
It &apos;s , like , this website .
It &apos;s a polymathematical website .
And here is the last bit .
Chef : Do you ?
Chef : Oh .
Chef : You can &apos;t ?
IM : Is that all it is ?
Sorry , what ?
IM : Churns ?
Chef : For cream ?
IM : Yeah , exactly .
IM : Yeah , it is , exactly .
Well , that &apos;s it . Thank you very much .
Thanks . Bye .
And you want to go back and do it again .
They &apos;ve made a selection .
It &apos;s too late . That is gone .
Manifest destiny .
So we &apos;re going to go straight into this .
Can I have the lights off for a moment ?
That &apos;s because it &apos;s cheaper .
In the summer , you go to the beach .
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .
They were able to create that .
This is happening by itself .
It transforms through the magic of lighting .
It &apos;s all about sensuality . It &apos;s all about touch .
Let &apos;s see it one more time .
It &apos;s about stimulation .
Why has the record been so poor ?
It &apos;s an election .
They moved on to some other situation .
You can do that quite fast .
One is jobs .
So jobs , health , and clean government .
Those are the three critical priorities .
Jobs .
That is not a good idea .
It &apos;s not sustainable .
What might the bottlenecks be ?
First you need access to land .
What &apos;s the goal ?
Where would that leave us ?
George Whitesides : Toward a science of simplicity
The trouble is , I don &apos;t .
So , what is simplicity ?
Why is that important ?
Well , it enables you to drink coffee .
And the two here are just examples .
And that &apos;s a simple question .
It &apos;s like , what is simplicity ?
What is the state of science ?
And it &apos;s like the traffic that you see .
The answer is , not a lot .
And that &apos;s complexity .
Anything else is more complicated .
So , for example , stones .
It just is not possible .
So these are the components .
Thank you very much .
Quick question .
Have you started to do that ?
GW : Well , no .
It stops babies from dying .
Why don &apos;t you just shake their hands .
Please shake their hands .
All right , get to know each other .
They look really pretty .
All right .
Actually , soap is available .
So why is it ?
Did you learn to wash your hands at home ?
Thank you .
Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size .
There &apos;s burrowing birds .
That &apos;s the animal that thumb claw came from : Suchomimus .
Here &apos;s some others .
... as long as their boat .
I got the back legs .
I &apos;ve got it . I &apos;ve got the back legs .
Somebody get the front legs .
Wow .
Sixty-five . Wow .
That &apos;s a big skull .
One , two , three !
Whoa !
We found this last year .
This is a ceremonial disk .
We have downgraded this factor .
Who &apos;s pointing fingers ?
I found myself in art .
It became abstract .
This is a very extraordinarily visual .
And we created a track record .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s second nature to them .
The first is redistribution markets .
It &apos;s kind of ridiculous , right ?
Thank you very much .
This is a training ground .
So , how do you do that ?
It doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s spam .
How about you get on the phone ?
That doesn &apos;t move .
It &apos;s a letter .
Letters actually work .
So , here you go .
&quot; Obviously , you &apos;re intelligent .
Why is is this important ?
Get writing .
So let me first start with the personal reason .
So that &apos;s the personal reason .
Thank you .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s indicated in the green outlines .
Doctor : How many are these ?
Patient : These are two things .
Doctor : What are their shapes ?
Patient : Their shapes ...
Patient : I can &apos;t make it out .
Doctor : Now ?
Patient : Triangle .
Doctor : How many things are these ?
Now , how many things are these ?
Patient : Two .
Doctor : What are these things ?
PS : And we see this pattern over and over again .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
So that &apos;s what we did .
Thank you very much .
I collaborate with bacteria .
Thank you .
God forbid .
We &apos;re not winning .
We can &apos;t scale .
Why is that ?
Because we don &apos;t have the resources .
And that &apos;s really clear now .
That &apos;s where all the resources come from .
But that profit is the magic .
Business should give more .
I &apos;m proud of that .
That &apos;s been the conventional wisdom .
They resisted environmental improvement .
That &apos;s where the real profit comes .
Let &apos;s take pollution .
It saves money .
It doesn &apos;t waste resources .
That &apos;s shared value .
It &apos;s real . It &apos;s happening .
I &apos;m feeling it .
Thank you .
&quot; It was awesome .
Thank you .
So now everybody can join .
There &apos;s so many of you .
Stand up for yourself .
Geek . Fatty . Slut . Fag .
We were kids .
Now , not so much .
I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to be a writer . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Don &apos;t be stupid . &quot;
And I wasn &apos;t the only one .
Silly . Foolish . Impossible .
But I kept dreaming .
Poetry .
This is who I am .
This is how I stand up for myself .
Not really a big deal .
I saw no reason to lie .
The classics were , &quot; Hey stupid , &quot; &quot; Hey spaz . &quot;
They have to be wrong .
Why else would we still be here ?
Of course they did .
And doctors hate it , right ?
I mean , they complain about it all the time .
People brush and floss their teeth .
They had a big patient population .
So go brush and floss your teeth .
So the upshot was this .
So fear showed up as not really the driver .
It was the sense of efficacy .
It &apos;s an amazing notion .
Except , maybe we do .
So let me just spool it out a little bit .
Okay , I know where I sit . I know where I &apos;m situated .
But it actually hits home .
We always are . We &apos;re always going above the speed limit .
But we have an opportunity .
This is a pharmaceutical ad .
Because we know .
There is no good faith in this .
So this is a different approach .
They &apos;re packed with information .
They go right to doctors .
It should be the patient .
It &apos;s being lost .
And then , what &apos;s next ?
And this information is out there .
Thank you very much .
But one thing is clear .
And the idea has two core stages .
So again , we got the short end of the deal there .
They really become nature &apos;s wave attenuators .
So the water is churned through this raft .
And then those spat are then seeded .
New word .
I get asked two questions about this project .
Thank you .
And I think this isn &apos;t just chance .
And I said , &quot; That &apos;s a great idea . &quot;
So that kid would do fine in the crash .
They were almost impossible to swallow .
Thank you very much .
Bottom right are the sex chromosomes .
Is that a big number ?
So it &apos;s really quite big .
It &apos;s called the Beijing Genomics Institute .
She goes home .
Significant problems remained .
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced .
The year after it &apos;s $ 100 , give or take a year .
That &apos;s how fast this is moving .
Today , it &apos;s here .
None , not one .
Look , this is where we are today .
But what would have happened if I had said C ?
And it looks really good .
Do you think that &apos;s not going to happen ?
Anybody ? Nobody .
Typically , there &apos;s one or two .
They all hated each other .
Now this is probably a good thing , right ?
You have bigger clan gatherings and so on .
But maybe it &apos;s a bad thing as well .
Thank you .
I can &apos;t believe in the doctrines .
I &apos;d like to kick off by looking at education .
That &apos;s a lovely idea .
They asked themselves the following question .
They said culture .
And that &apos;s a very plausible idea .
they &apos;d go , &quot; No , no . I don &apos;t need one of those .
Religions go , &quot; Nonsense .
&quot; The new is better than the old . &quot;
What is a calendar ?
Now we don &apos;t think that way .
I &apos;ll just come across it . &quot;
Nonsense , says the religious world view .
You &apos;ll be handed rice cakes .
That &apos;s very good .
All right , all right . We &apos;re getting there . We &apos;re getting there .
They tell us to have a bath .
Let &apos;s look at art now .
You &apos;ve heard that saying .
And that &apos;s what art is .
Art should be didactic .
Let &apos;s think of something else .
And that has all sorts of advantages .
We need to group together .
And that &apos;s what religions do .
That &apos;s something we can learn from .
I want to conclude .
Thank you very much .
Indeed .
And that &apos;s really the spirit of my talk .
There &apos;s so much we can absorb .
You move on .
It doesn &apos;t need it .
That would be good , right ?
Very good .
That &apos;s all it takes .
Go !
So , what do we want to see ?
Got that ?
We &apos;re clapping for that ?
That &apos;s amazing .
Nice , nice .
Keep it up . I love it !
Touch is even better .
So this is true .
Yeah ! Awesome .
Wait , wait , wait .
Well , here &apos;s my suggestion .
Pretty clever , right ?
Thank you .
It &apos;s about nine feet high .
Well , this was the first solution .
You don &apos;t want just any mountain .
January 7003 . There it is .
Then there &apos;s the return .
Something that &apos;s just yours .
What do you look for ?
That &apos;s interesting .
They don &apos;t quite , but it &apos;s something to think about .
They don &apos;t quite meet .
And it &apos;s a pretty interesting scene .
The weather station &apos;s pretty interesting .
You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon .
And he dashed across the top of the mountains .
In fact , there he is . That &apos;s Alexander Rose .
One is the experience of the mountain .
Another is the experience in the mountain .
It &apos;s a very nice ranch .
Thank you .
CP : Okay .
There I go .
&#91; Basque &#93; Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Season follows the pre-season .
That &apos;s been medicalized as well .
Strike three is menopause .
So , just take a moment .
It &apos;s called pre-death .
I made up pre-death .
I didn &apos;t make up pre-vivor .
You are a pre-vivor .
We are all responsible .
I &apos;m responsible .
Thank you .
But everyone is responsible .
And that &apos;s actually true .
Thanks .
And there are obviously all kinds of things .
Somebody ? What ?
Now , how do you do this ?
What ?
Experience .
Next up is knowledge .
I don &apos;t know who the players are .
You &apos;ve got to know your area .
Well , leadership .
You &apos;ve got to have vision .
And you have to have rational projections and stuff .
You need to be coachable .
We &apos;ve had a lot of experience .
Okay , so how do you do that ?
Well , first of all , logical progression .
And the whole -- it &apos;s got to flow from beginning to end .
And that &apos;s two parts .
So it &apos;s got to be both sides .
And it &apos;s a very tricky path to do it .
Bill Gates &apos; PowerPoint presentation over here .
What do you think ?
What are you focusing on ?
No , they &apos;re not .
The long bullet points are bad .
What &apos;s good ? Short , short bullet points .
But you know what ?
Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points .
Just give me the headline over here .
And you know what ?
Basically none .
What do you do ?
And then , you come back to me .
I don &apos;t need all that .
You know , don &apos;t do a live demo .
No , never do a live demo .
And , you know , how many widgets are you going to sell ?
Two million at 100,000 .
What &apos;s the money in so far ? Who invested ?
I hope you invested personally .
Because I &apos;m following on .
This is that rocket going up .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; This is really , really great . &quot;
Just your logo on the screen .
And I look at the logo -- okay , good .
And now , you &apos;ve got to wrap it up and tie it up here .
So , I couldn &apos;t even see if I wanted to .
What do you think I &apos;m looking at ?
You think that I &apos;m looking at that ?
So David &apos;s top five presentation tips .
Number four : always use remote control .
Have you seen me touch the computer ?
No , you haven &apos;t . Why not ?
Because I &apos;m using remote control over here .
Always use remote control .
But it &apos;s not really good as a handout .
So most everyone watches TV .
Here in America , people actually love TV .
Okay ?
They , in fact , berate it .
We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
We feel awe , we feel pity .
We love to watch TV .
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
What did this mean for you ?
Okay , here we go .
Why ?
Look what happens .
In 1970 , inspiration plummets .
Moral ambiguity takes off .
It &apos;s trying to recover .
Take a look at this .
Irreverence starts to rise .
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
What &apos;s number one ?
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Viewers had responded dramatically .
That &apos;s what we mean by a breakout show .
So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
Now look at this .
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
What were those shows ?
Glamorous and rich .
&quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; Fantasy Island . &quot;
Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
But look : X marks the spot .
Why not ?
We had the bursting of the tech bubble .
We had 9 / 11 .
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .
Look what happens when we keep going .
No , they want judgment .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
So thanks very much .
To honor and remember .
This is ours .
DR : I like that word .
We were really paralyzed .
It was just extraordinary .
DR : Yeah .
DR : It was not an inclusive group .
Shocking .
DR : Yeah , surprising .
On the Hudson River ?
There was no filter .
And we met with him .
And we said , &quot; That &apos;s incredible ! &quot;
It &apos;s scaffolding and plywood .
DR : No , I don &apos;t think so .
It enables that conversation to get serious .
Those kinds of forms ?
Ze Frank : Nerdcore comedy
This is really embarrassing .
I &apos;m really sorry .
What &apos;s your name ?
And that &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
That &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
Am I feeling lucky ?
Am I feeling lucky ?
Audience : Yes .
For example , somebody wrote me .
And that was embarrassing .
Voice : Hey , moron , get off the stage .
ZF : You get off the stage .
And frog mode .
I think they &apos;re wonderful .
Darling . Beautiful stuff .
These are haikus .
Oh , this is how you make puppets .
Well , so says George W. Bush .
What do I have in mind ?
Now what would that look like ?
It will be transformative of Islam as well .
So the risks are very great .
Thanks .
A robot .
He said , &quot; Is the robot real ? &quot;
We called it the Tele-Actor .
We were totally surprised .
And she said they hadn &apos;t .
And we go through this several rounds .
And here &apos;s the result .
Here &apos;s seven times .
Maybe it runs in the family .
Thank you .
It &apos;s getting pretty close to finished now .
OK , well , we fight .
I can move around here . I can extend .
I &apos;ll inflate them kind of large .
And I &apos;ll also give it a few legs .
And I can see how it might dance .
So , this is the planet that the player evolved on .
Here it goes .
Thank you .
What is love ?
I can love jogging .
I can love escalopes .
I can love my wife .
This phenomenon is modernity .
How many people are going to love me ? &quot;
But how ?
But rest assured : so are you .
We are all useless .
What is tenderness ?
That &apos;s pretty bad .
I refer to self-mockery .
What does the system look like ?
What does that mean ?
I have a couple of ideas to begin with .
These are just some starting points .
So the People &apos;s Building , as we called it .
Sustainability .
China symbolized by the dragon .
Denmark , we have a national bird , the swan .
You can try it .
This is my apartment .
So we took the commission .
They create shelter from the wind .
They accumulate the solar energy .
They accumulate the water .
Yes , maybe just to round off .
Thank you .
All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy .
These are stars being born out of here .
We found this one last year .
He was Darwin &apos;s cousin .
Why would that matter ?
Three different options .
That &apos;s a big deal .
Just a thought .
These conditions are highly rare .
Here &apos;s the bottom line .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m really scared .
That is not enough .
This is my big vision .
These are also called mesh networks .
Zero dollars a month .
These things are going to happen .
What is the point ?
Thank you .
I decided to go with the latter .
I &apos;m going to talk about Rome .
And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter .
So they all have his number .
But it was the journey of the ...
This is something that &apos;s a little bit unusual .
Thank you very much .
And they were left behind , waiting to die .
I &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
Thank you very much .
It really goes beyond distinction .
Architects love to hate it .
Where would it go ?
It can &apos;t go in the Mall .
It has to be something entirely different .
It has to be air .
And it has to be free .
The before and the after .
It was dubbed &quot; the bubble &quot; by the press .
That was the lounge .
The membrane is translucent .
So it &apos;s down the hierarchy on lighting .
So it comes to the site twice a year .
It &apos;s hoisted .
And then it &apos;s restrained with the cables .
This is the warp and weft .
This is a point cloud .
Form and content are together here .
Thank you .
And I &apos;m not really going to talk much about the economy .
That is a huge effect .
People really like to have sex .
But we really need to test that .
So that &apos;s what this figure shows you .
This is not just through malaria .
So this is another way to see this .
It &apos;s good for improving people &apos;s lives .
It &apos;s been widely heralded .
So thank you very much .
So water was something that scared me to begin with .
But I would go in on occasion .
That is something that I did not get over .
And I would like to share my art .
So , moving onward .
Swimming , first principles .
First principles , this is very important .
So the clock started ticking .
I tried kickboards .
The problem is hydrodynamics .
The arm is extended below the head .
Here is an example of the stroke .
You can see this is the left extension .
Then you see his left leg .
Not their fault , honestly .
And that will get you very far .
Languages . Material versus method .
I arrived in Tokyo . Amazing .
I walked in to school .
And so it came to me in waves .
There had been something lost in translation .
And now I love languages .
The instructor says , &quot; You are participating . &quot;
Immediately : death sweat .
&quot; Okay , come on , grab me . &quot;
Gorgeous assistant instructor .
Everyone burst into laughter . I was humiliated .
I found that longer steps were much more elegant .
Secondly , different types of pivots .
Thirdly , variation in tempo .
I &apos;m going to jump forward here .
His name is Gabriel Misse .
Alicia , in her own right , very famous .
So then we broke it down .
This is a back step pivot .
There are many different types .
Thank you very much .
The energy crisis was in full bore .
That got me very excited .
But they didn &apos;t believe me .
First , the coursework at Caltech .
So what about making energy ?
Those shapes are parabolas .
And this is the shape that evolved .
You can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now .
Those were major breakthroughs .
Another type of engine is the hot air engine .
Put a flame under it , the piston moves up .
That &apos;s a heat engine .
We applied the genetic algorithm .
We got the results from that for the optimal engine .
Let me show you what it looks like in real life .
So this is the engine .
The exact converse is also true .
Thank you .
It doesn &apos;t really care .
and you also get hot water .
The hot water &apos;s optional .
This is the map of the United States .
And of course , look at Africa .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
So , how do we do that ?
Fair enough .
I didn &apos;t know it coming into it .
I &apos;m convinced of it .
Awful .
She was in a great evening gown .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m learning . &quot;
We all knew that .
She stayed in her room .
The usual sort of thing .
An amazing woman .
She said , &quot; Come to my apartment . &quot;
She lived in New York .
And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life .
She agreed .
Thank you very much .
And that &apos;s what you see here .
I made a stacking board .
And , again , that was just for the joy of it .
So I &apos;d like to leave you with two thoughts .
Well , this is 2009 .
What happened ?
Everybody knew the answer .
That explained everything .
Shock , horror .
It &apos;s not a minority theory .
Nobody has questioned it .
It &apos;s what we ought to be doing .
Well I don &apos;t think that .
I mean , look at the elephant .
Peals of merry laughter !
And take bipedality .
Look at the fat layer .
Why should it be there ?
We can speak .
I don &apos;t believe it .
Everybody likes the aquatic theory .
They say &quot; Well ...
And they can &apos;t all be wrong , can they ? &quot;
Anybody else out there ? Come on in .
The water is lovely .
And now we &apos;ve got to look to the future .
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon .
Academia says no .
The textbooks don &apos;t mention it .
Right . I &apos;ll go ahead with that .
I &apos;ll go along with that too .
Thank you very much .
The air was fetid , the room a shambles .
&apos;Thank you for coming , Steve .
Tell the clocks to stop .
Thank you .
I shrugged and followed them .
&apos;We &apos;ve got to case the joint .
I had two earlier in England .
I never struck anyone .
There &apos;s nothing benign about it .
The mission is not yet complete .
You &apos;re offering to put me in hospitals ?
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . You &apos;re very kind .
Thank you .
The story begins in the late &apos; 90s .
Expertise has for sure had its moments .
And that was only the beginning .
We are playing with fire .
So we are doing our job .
Well , you have two things .
He gave me my pick of units .
One , they &apos;re infantry .
If we could roll ?
SP : I &apos;m not the media , dammit !
It &apos;s natural instinct .
MM : Every single time you go out there , there &apos;s attacks .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
Soldiers : IV ! Are we on fire ? IV !
MM : They &apos;re shooting at me .
SP : We &apos;re here to create money .
Michael Moriarty &apos;s Wife : He &apos;s not the same person anymore .
MM : I will not go back .
I hope .
Paul ? Come on , stand up .
And I want to say , I was nervous .
If we could roll the clip .
SP : Today is sport . &#91; Unclear &#93; Radio : &#91; Unclear &#93; Christian soldiers .
It &apos;s not true . Very unsafe .
Whoa .
Right there .
SP : All right , let &apos;s get over to that site .
Motherfuckers !
Hey , get over the fucking -- yeah , yeah .
I &apos;ll walk you through it .
SP : Stay low . Head over to the right .
SP : It was mass casualties .
This is the scene north .
This is blood .
And that &apos;s it , that &apos;s all that &apos;s left .
SP : We made the news .
They didn &apos;t have to go outside the wire .
There &apos;s such a disconnect .
I &apos;ll share one story .
Or you know , these things .
He &apos;s a big guy .
And he wasn &apos;t going to blink .
The gunner was throwing candy .
And then I &apos;m going to tell her . &quot;
You go and see anybody ?
Are you a friend to them ?
Do you really care ?
And really do give them a hug .
Thank you .
Text : BeatJazz .
Why ?
But mostly ...
Think about that .
That &apos;s the metaphor , the old metaphor .
Age as pathology .
And guess what ?
And I got scared .
I thought , oh my gosh .
I don &apos;t want to romanticize aging .
Some of it , obviously , is genetic .
And there isn &apos;t much we can do about that .
Myself included .
And here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
As I diminished , I grew .
And so we can feel unfinished .
How was I supposed to live it ?
What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act ?
These kinds of things .
It wasn &apos;t your fault ; you &apos;re just fine .
We have agency .
We are the subjects of our own lives .
And we become the subjects and objects of other people &apos;s lives .
Thank you very much .
And we went in , pretending to be buyers .
It was unacceptable .
The mother bears are usually killed .
He has a telephone booth .
We gave cycle rickshaws .
And I was permanently hooked .
Nobody &apos;s in charge .
So bees have social healthcare .
It &apos;s a natural antibiotic .
So what &apos;s going on ?
And then there &apos;s pesticides .
You &apos;ve probably heard about it .
This is a new class of insecticides .
It &apos;s called varroa destructor .
It &apos;s aptly named .
We need all of our bees .
Set aside farmland .
On behalf of the bees , thank you .
So it &apos;s getting precarious .
We &apos;re kind of at a tipping point .
Thank you .
And I &apos;ve stuck to that .
It &apos;s qualitatively different .
What &apos;s really going on ?
People are following opportunity into town .
And this is why .
There is plenty going on .
And then gradually gentrifies .
And the nations they &apos;re in can help .
You look at that lane on the right .
And you can ask , &quot; Okay what &apos;s going on there ? &quot;
The answer is , &quot; Everything . &quot;
It &apos;s much more interactive .
And the scale is terrific .
There &apos;s all kinds of activity .
Proximity is amazing .
More than half .
And that will determine a lot of how we function .
People get into town .
Shows what is happening .
And they are regionally separated .
Here &apos;s just a few samples .
This is good for the atmosphere .
It &apos;s good for their prosperity .
They &apos;re typically buried in the ground .
And the innovation is moving very rapidly .
This is a moral issue .
This is a list of them .
So here is where we are .
Thank you .
I wound up on every television show .
Can you say that ?
Audience : Early detection , early response .
Day eight .
1974 , we were down to five countries .
And that &apos;s what we did .
That is the surveillance system .
And let me show you why that is .
But you don &apos;t get to do that usually .
You usually arrive right about here .
Hello , Ron .
No . I love it .
And the consensus was : it really worked .
So the first one is called the ventral stream .
It &apos;s on this side of the brain .
It &apos;s the selective logic .
So the point of this is what ?
You can ask the question , &quot; Who &apos;s the boss ? &quot;
You &apos;ll be able to figure that out .
I had to do something .
This fishing village was famous for sculpture .
So I tried bronze casting .
I was mesmerized .
My life was not going to be the same .
Its shape was too complex now .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Yeah , times 10 .
Just open it .
Just have a look at the plants .
What is a pest ?
Let &apos;s have a look at that .
And there is another example : aphids .
No males at all .
Parthenogenesis , &#91; as it &#93; was so called .
But this is the end result .
And this is of course not the end of it .
If you can see this , sweet peppers .
What we do is actually this .
Many different parts .
You see this ampoule . You see this one .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
And what is the impact ?
Why good bugs ?
It hardly happens .
Have a look at the gap .
Twenty-five billion .
Step by step , it does narrow .
Thank you .
And they didn &apos;t plan right .
And they &apos;re tearing up all the streets .
The electric iron , also very big .
So it wasn &apos;t a big seller .
And it would clean your clothes .
I took this picture just two days ago .
It &apos;s a total , total mess .
John Maeda : My journey in design
Who has a computer ? Yeah .
This was how computing began .
I mean , this was great .
A bad sort of branding thing , or whatever .
And that was torture , real torture .
And I was really good at school .
A very difficult time , actually .
It was very hard to make this , actually .
And this is in 1993 .
They were saying , Why &apos;s it moving ?
And I said , Never .
So , this happened in 1993 .
Sound down , please .
It &apos;s put inside the computer .
He went into a coma .
Is this what we want , you know ?
You get it ? No ? O.K.
It didn &apos;t make any sense .
I made this series of works .
Recently , this is for Reebok .
The world is just so tasty .
No , they &apos;re all out there .
We all are creative people .
It &apos;s everywhere on the beach , I discovered .
And I also discovered how .
This is also out there , you know .
I brought you guys together again .
And I went after it with passion .
I was , like , aha , wait a second .
And there RISD appeared .
So , thank you everyone .
We &apos;re warming the climate .
And they can handle water .
It &apos;s really messy .
They are very hardworking people .
What &apos;s going on underwater ?
But you can see it .
Okay .
So do sea turtles .
He has no bookings left .
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool .
Here they are working .
It &apos;s just ridiculous .
These birds make a living by diving into the water .
And you &apos;d have some idea of what to do .
We seem to be waking up a little bit .
So it &apos;s a continued fight .
Who says it &apos;s too expensive ?
People who sell us fossil fuels .
It &apos;s a matter of right and wrong .
Thank you very much .
Now , this was very effective .
You want to eat ? Somebody else wants to eat ?
Why is this not enough ?
It &apos;s a past tense .
So this is the word &quot; tell . &quot;
So , who told ? I told .
They &apos;re directly constructing the sentence .
Let &apos;s talk about speech .
This is speech .
Why is it one-dimensional ?
The data structure of thought .
It &apos;s not very complicated code .
Language is beautiful .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
I think I &apos;ve always been that way .
For example , we are all going to die .
It could address a child or an adult .
Oleander is poisonous .
Yeah .
This sun is not afraid to show his face .
He might have been up all night .
And it can make us afraid .
Thanks .
It &apos;s a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers .
The stories started pouring out .
You have to go in a school bus . &quot;
Absolutely vital .
Is it working ?
Let &apos;s go to schools .
And so the state can come in .
Life is too complex for ...
The constitution is only 16 pages long .
This is the hardest hurdle .
This is an illusion .
How do we try to understand what China is ?
We can &apos;t .
It &apos;s never been the case .
And what does it mean ?
One country , two systems .
&quot; Window dressing .
What happened ?
One nation , one system .
That is the nation-state mentality .
It doesn &apos;t work .
So the question is , why ?
The state is everywhere in China .
It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
But it &apos;s not .
And there are two consequences of this .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
Take the 19th century , for example .
But this , alas , is no longer true .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .
My father was a San Franciscan .
That all disappeared .
We were penniless .
We had lost everything .
All men are created equal .
They all fell silently .
Thank you very much .
It is rather revolting .
So that is a pitiable state of affairs .
Open defecation is rampant .
A fantastic distinction .
We are fighting against this .
And that is the end product .
And boys , about 30 percent .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t want to depress you too much .
Instead , we spend our time talking .
They will completely lose .
And one other thing : it &apos;s fast .
And the answer seems to be yes .
That &apos;s called the photophoretic force .
And the box has two knobs .
We have no global governance .
But I have a lot of reservations .
Thank you very much .
Nellie McKay : &quot; Clonie &quot;
&quot; Ha , I &apos;m the only person I ever loved . &quot;
That &apos;s all there is to it .
Thank you very much .
So , let &apos;s leave that aside .
It &apos;s not only cold , but very dry .
I call these creatures sunflowers .
Thank you .
Very interesting .
And that &apos;s my specialty , right ?
So , these are the problems .
Does he look like he &apos;s happy ?
Yes , let &apos;s just go work this thing out .
And we were doing open-heart surgery .
The oxygen tanks didn &apos;t quite work right .
And that &apos;s a perfect example of one .
That &apos;s exactly how the outlets are designed .
This is what makes it so special .
This picture was taken last year .
Thank you .
He got a medical doctor .
You have six months .
That was our task .
Come on .
Okay . All right .
They leave a lifelong remnant .
That &apos;s our average budget .
It &apos;s very easy to spend money .
Thank you .
And we &apos;ll go a lot further than that .
Okay , what do we do ?
We wash the bug out .
So how do we do that ?
A 40-percent reduction .
Health was poor .
It was choking with smoke .
And I don &apos;t pretend anything else .
And that , to me , is the key .
People are not the problem .
Thank you very much for your time .
Now , I had friends in the U.S.
I had four phases to this plan .
and ideas du bon marche .
And one more thing : No , don &apos;t F it up . &quot;
This is all true .
Anywhere you go .
It really is his name .
Look at it now .
Enough .
Thank you .
They &apos;re little . They &apos;re five years old .
They say , &quot; Really ? How many ? &quot;
How do you monetize that ?
But they have to be asked .
What were they to do about this ?
Well , charity became their answer .
There are a lot of problems with this question .
I &apos;m going to just focus on two .
The overhead went up .
Now we &apos;re talking scale .
Thank you .
It &apos;s called Sankofa .
Thank you very much .
So , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve done with my life .
Thank you .
There was no opponent directly across from you .
Oh , watch this .
Mental note on that one .
And this one here ? An ollie .
Here &apos;s some images of that .
There &apos;s something called a primo slide .
It &apos;s like skinboarding .
And so , when it was the crazy thing .
This is a place not that far from here .
And then you &apos;ve got some of these guys , right ?
These are my peers .
Because it &apos;s not just the mind .
You know ?
This is Sea-Monkeys .
So , these are miracles , right ?
And it &apos;s true . It &apos;s true .
It &apos;s a really good thing .
You know ?
We make it ourselves .
It &apos;s an extraordinarily toxic thing .
It &apos;s really going to be OK . &quot;
It stopped moving .
It appeared dead .
Now , this was cosmic .
Well this was really cool .
A miracle ?
Thank you very much .
AV : We did .
These are our three sons .
AV : We , or I ?
RG : I &apos;m sorry .
Misuse of the pronoun .
And I was there with my arms open .
And it was also , of course , surreal .
You &apos;re either in love , or you &apos;re not in love .
You love , or you don &apos;t love .
RG : Uh oh .
RG : The far left . AV : No !
RG : Cruel .
I &apos;ll move on to taboo number two .
So it was a very difficult time .
There &apos;s really no ceremony , rituals , or rites .
We were despondent .
It can &apos;t possibly be that bad .
So I &apos;m not going to go .
Can we move that up a little bit ?
RG + AV : Thank you .
Baking soda and vinegar .
It &apos;s a strange kind of love .
Voices : Woohoo ! Yeah . Nice .
They &apos;re yelling deploy . Voices : Oh shit .
SJ : And I &apos;ll just be quiet .
Voices : No .
Up , up , up .
Things often go wrong .
Thank you .
This is only 1,000 galaxies .
It &apos;s a very large number of galaxies .
We &apos;re going to try and follow it up .
You see the whole big picture ?
And it &apos;s maturing up to the present time .
How are you going to end up doing that ?
What &apos;s the kind of technique ?
What &apos;s the kind of thing you &apos;re going to do ?
It &apos;s called dark matter .
We &apos;re going to zoom in and zoom in .
So we &apos;re zooming in .
We &apos;re going to keep zooming in . OK .
So here &apos;s that same end result .
That &apos;s the issue , right ?
And so here we are .
So there it is .
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material .
Thank you .
Oh , well .
Now , while ...
I &apos;ll give you three examples .
It &apos;s perfectly fine .
Thank you very much .
Please close your eyes , and open your hands .
Now open your eyes .
What about a life ?
What you see here is a premature baby .
So , this is what we came up with .
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby .
There &apos;s no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily .
This is a phase-change material .
And they said , &quot; Absolutely not . &quot;
They had not slept .
And they decided to do it .
It &apos;s great work .
That &apos;s a big deal . It really is .
I know . I know . I know .
Number one : high expectations .
He retook the course .
He now works at Harvard .
Secondly , it &apos;s not about test scores only .
There was fire in that belly .
And so high expectations , very important .
Let me get the staff to help me out . &quot;
It was that connecting .
Give him a big hand for that .
Do you know that ?
They need to be engaged .
It &apos;s called academic innovation .
And what does all of that mean ?
Thank you all very much .
But this is it .
That &apos;s it without the case on .
Thanks .
Thomas Thwaites . TT : Thanks .
We will see 30,000 new infected websites .
Well you , my friend , you &apos;ve came to the right place .
Turns out that &apos;s not cool .
But it goes further .
This is a little USB key .
Well , you could try looking really cute .
Awww .
Or , in my case , awkward and pathetic .
What I &apos;m going to do is plug in the USB key .
That can be very embarrassing .
This is a script .
We really should clean that up .
We used Google .
They were working on the third floor .
Let me come back to that in just a minute .
Let &apos;s talk about you .
Things get more interesting .
Would someone be able to abuse it ? &quot;
Get a secure password .
Find these resources . Apply them .
Thank you .
This song kind of came out of all of that .
What have they ever done for me ? &quot;
They don &apos;t speak the same language .
It is simply having more consideration for others .
That &apos;s good news , isn &apos;t it ?
He &apos;s very kind .
And then not only humans .
Rather , the opposite .
So that &apos;s good news .
Now look at here .
No , that &apos;s expected , isn &apos;t it ?
Now , look at this .
But that &apos;s not the end of it .
No choice ?
So what is altruism ?
But empathy alone is not sufficient .
So is individual change possible ?
They have not been trained .
Now where do we go from there ?
So now where do we go from there ?
Individual change is possible .
That &apos;s the good news .
So where do we go from there ?
Myself , I will go back to the East .
There &apos;s always positive deviance .
We need three things .
Not sustainable growth anymore .
Sentient beings are co-citizens in this world .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s take a closer look .
Let &apos;s look at one example here .
Thank you .
They &apos;re wrong .
This is perhaps my favorite .
You have to hack your target .
The company has also hired a spokesperson .
They &apos;ve spoken at the conferences .
I &apos;d never heard of it .
Thank you very much .
So , fast forward a few years .
I &apos;d gone through some changes .
I was euphoric .
It was absolutely wonderful .
So I grow my own beansprouts .
Question number two : How do you sleep ?
What do I wear ?
Do I have a chase boat ?
I tried to tell them to go away .
We had a bit of a battle of wills .
Awful , really awful .
But what do you do ?
Fall down nine times , get up 10 .
They were going very slowly .
That &apos;s just one example .
This is a world-wide community .
It &apos;s meant to be a bit of a game .
Thank you .
So let the story begin .
Let me show you .
Tree . Chair . Girl .
NT : Yes , that was a big mistake .
He became a recluse .
Thank you .
And I was the product of a working-class community .
Neither of them attended university .
I know , how romantic .
We all know .
And that &apos;s important to keep in mind .
Please remember that .
I never did it .
I loved getting As .
I liked being smart .
You too can pave the way .
Because we are counting on you .
Because the world is big .
And it &apos;s full of challenges .
The 0.1 percent in the U.S.
Just think about it .
Just think about it .
We have superstar technologists .
We have superstar bankers .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
I &apos;m even more of a fan of globalization .
Well , a few things .
And that &apos;s no mere hypothetical example .
Let &apos;s start with technology .
The same is true of globalization .
We created public education .
We created unions .
We need a new New Deal .
We can &apos;t see into the engine room .
A photo is not enough . &quot;
Remind you of anyone ?
The universe disappears .
You can &apos;t see the future , obviously .
Taste buds , every 10 days or so .
Okay . Atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
Gas , you can &apos;t see that .
But well done , him .
Electricity , you can &apos;t see that .
And he said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve no idea .
You take off and land at a local airport .
And it works .
That &apos;s real time .
Radio : It actually flew . Yes .
Radio 2 : That was gorgeous .
Radio : What did you think of that ?
Here &apos;s why .
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure .
Who knows ?
And it has .
Let me give you an example .
Now , choices are anxiety-provoking .
They are linked to risks , losses .
They are highly unpredictable .
I looked at this woman in shock .
Ignorance and denial are on the rise .
Now , what does that mean ?
Thank you .
That &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
Imagine that .
And he might be right .
It &apos;s not really a problem .
You have nobody to make eye contact with .
That &apos;s sort of a bogus concept .
This is Starbucks , you know .
They &apos;re places for people .
Thank you .
So why is that ?
Or maybe you turn to the past .
Maybe you look at the past and see .
And , sadly , we don &apos;t know .
Africans have already got a lot of aid .
These are the blue bars .
There &apos;s only one Africa .
So what do you do ?
We don &apos;t know .
So here are some other questions .
Bed nets are very cheap .
So , what do you do ?
How do you know ?
And a third question : Education .
But how do you do that ?
Do you provide school lunch ?
So here is the thing .
So I start with immunization .
So what is the problem ?
So what do we find ?
Well , beforehand , everything is the same .
That &apos;s full immunization .
That &apos;s not bad , that &apos;s a good improvement .
So here you &apos;ve got your answer .
We cannot keep giving lentils to people . &quot;
How about bed nets ?
We can just run an experiment .
So , how about the purchasing ?
How about the long term ?
So what &apos;s the best ?
And yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
So , why is that ?
There &apos;s no silver bullet .
And that &apos;s very frustrating .
Deworming .
So this evidence is powerful .
It can prompt action .
It &apos;s a very slow process .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s start here .
Can you spot the vegetable ?
A post that read : &quot; Goodbye . &quot;
Except , of course , this morning .
What would this lead to ?
World peace .
The telephone ?
You guessed it : world peace .
More media always means more arguing .
All right . They look like org charts .
The programmers come and go .
His point of view on this was very clear .
This is the big change .
So , the law is also dependency-related .
Right .
This is a called a &quot; diff , &quot; this thing on the right here .
The stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted .
So consider this .
Can we use them ?
Thank you for listening .
Thank you . Thank you .
I &apos;m a historian .
It was deeply classified .
So we had a few kayaks .
It would take 2,000 or 3,000 bombs .
This is what &apos;s happened at 600 microseconds .
These are stills from the video .
So , thanks to him .
The Air Force version : here we have a military version .
Results : none .
This project is hereby terminated .
Then came the end of the Cold War .
Why do they call it that ?
It &apos;s buying it .
Again , globalization Chinese style .
Well it &apos;s China &apos;s turn again .
Then there is trade .
Now it encourages it .
Let &apos;s start with Iraq .
The reason is Kurdistan .
No . It &apos;s the pipelines .
I don &apos;t believe we should .
It has no choice but to behave .
A great deal of them .
And that is , of course , Europe .
Now let &apos;s go up to the Arctic Circle .
Thank you .
How did you do ? &quot;
You know , like just adjacent to me .
So this is called &quot; Self In Progress . &quot;
This is called &quot; Dawn to Dawn . &quot;
So it took about 24 hours to get this line .
Can you just raise the hand ?
This is called &quot; Limit Out . &quot;
This is an exact negative .
Again , &quot; Inward Out . &quot;
It &apos;s a full-figure cast from myself .
It &apos;s about eight inches deep .
I couldn &apos;t find it .
It &apos;s called Odonil .
They never wrote back to me .
They said , &quot; Of course .
And they did .
I said , &quot; No , mom . It can &apos;t be .
It &apos;s called &quot; Emerging Angel . &quot;
This is after 15 / 20 days .
The same thing in the darkroom .
Again , throwing light , then the third one .
I thought , &quot; Oh , good . Work is finished . &quot;
You can see the detail .
This is called &quot; Gravity . &quot;
This is called &quot; Kaayam . &quot;
Detail .
Thank you .
I was the freak of the family .
I tagged along with my neighbors .
She &apos;s worried .
Who wrote that ?
And listen .
What issues deeply concern you ?
&quot; What ? &quot; she wanted to know .
Well , she was shocked .
Probably not .
I &apos;ll meet you there . &quot;
I was 21 .
Where does it come from ?
Who makes it ?
And for what ?
Communication was extremely difficult .
It &apos;s a kind loaner from TED .
That &apos;s my son , Oliver .
You ascend 30 stories .
There is a small person right down there on the ground .
These are huckleberry bushes .
This is a flying buttress .
Thank you very much .
RP : Thank you .
And that &apos;s Johnny Depp &apos;s shoulder .
That didn &apos;t happen to me .
I do that hourly .
I learned a lesson from it .
And okay , I wouldn &apos;t change it .
It &apos;s called a lobotomy .
What is regret ?
So in other words , regret requires two things .
And second of all , it requires imagination .
Why ?
Here &apos;s what the answers turn out to look like .
We wish we &apos;d taken better advantage of the education that we did have .
We all know the short answer .
It feels terrible . Regret feels awful .
So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial .
And the thought was , &quot; Make it go away ! &quot;
We &apos;re not trying to solve the problem .
We just want it to vanish .
What was I thinking ? &quot;
We don &apos;t understand that part .
Make it go away . Make it go away . &quot;
Text : Relpy to all .
Or you can have your last day at work .
We are all in this together .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case though .
So it &apos;s been several years since I got my own tattoo .
And do you guys just want to see it ?
All right .
This is my tattoo .
So let me reassure you about something .
Well it did .
Thank you .
You know , like that .
So -- again , isn &apos;t this great ?
Thank you .
We &apos;ve got a climate crisis .
They &apos;re the largest private user of electricity .
But the pay-off is really enormous .
Please . Thank you .
He &apos;s the father of the ethanol revolution .
Well , I &apos;ll tell you -- a lot .
Less than one day of Exxon &apos;s revenues .
Not enough to stabilize the climate .
Thank you very much .
Forty-three .
Seven .
It &apos;s got to be worth something , right ?
So everyone wins here , right ?
Now , the offenders , they also benefit .
The second piece it brings is rigor .
The last element is partnership .
So where does this leave us ?
Thank you .
Here &apos;s the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass .
There was massive flooding in Indonesia .
And what about the web ?
And it &apos;s clearly in the area of finance .
There are two Achilles &apos; heels of globalization .
It will continue .
So what will this do ?
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine .
It &apos;s going to require innovation .
The rest of our lives will be in the future . We need to prepare for it now .
It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring .
It is vital that we do so .
Thank you .
Yeah , Boston .
And it looks like this right now .
It &apos;s not very good . It &apos;s cluttered .
So , that &apos;s unfortunate .
I like it quite a lot .
That &apos;s a little scary .
That &apos;s an appointment .
You should lose points for not doing this on time .
And this is used in games as well .
And it &apos;s very powerful .
I would .
And they made this into a game , initially .
We can influence behavior .
This is an image of the planet Earth .
This is pretty amazing .
Is that possible ?
Vertically , you have the time .
How do we do that ?
This is all there .
&quot; How much will it cost ? &quot;
Maybe there are several maps .
I thank you very much .
Note that word &quot; cooperate . &quot;
The better the process , the less the friction .
Thank you .
They got two times as much money .
So we &apos;ve provided subtitles .
Poor Player : Just one .
Rich Player : I have three .
It &apos;s on the bottom right corner there .
Poor Player : I don &apos;t know .
Rich Player : I love pretzels .
Poor Player : How much is that ?
You &apos;re going to lose all your money soon .
I &apos;ll buy it . I have so much money .
So what do we do ?
Thank you .
But I don &apos;t think that &apos;s right .
Now it &apos;s just the way it is .
Thank you very much .
&quot; Oh ! That was my foot there ! &quot;
&quot; What does it matter ? &quot;
Is art about that ?
And if I vote it makes a difference .
The difference between thinking and doing .
It &apos;s made out of ice .
It &apos;s quite simple and fundamental .
So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities .
Is there a sense of consequences ?
It &apos;s about being together .
What does the word &quot; public &quot; mean today anyway ?
It &apos;s very much about this causality , consequences .
Experience is about responsibility .
With all the side effects ?
Which got me thinking .
Anyone in the audience want to take a stab ?
Okay , that &apos;s cool .
So , yeah , so this is again difficult .
How do you know that ?
Well we have two objective measures .
So what do you do ?
Thank you .
And why do I say that ?
Surveillance was really interesting .
Am I scaring you yet ?
You see the difference ?
This is plain text . This is encrypted .
That one &apos;s pretty easy to fix .
Don &apos;t waste computer cycles .
It &apos;s the Supreme Court , right ?
What does this all mean ?
Thank you very much .
Believe me , I &apos;ve tried .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks .
Thank you .
Okay , ready ? Go .
Okay .
I &apos;m sorry .
So I decided to give it a try .
And lightning struck .
I was hooked .
I don &apos;t have anything interesting to say . &quot;
I think that we all did .
She says I have old eyes .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Very lucky .
Mice are a very good representation .
This is one of them .
Where &apos;s our export ?
They did , yes .
That doesn &apos;t do a lot of good .
You understand a solar chimney .
Hot air rises .
They said things like this .
There &apos;s a good person .
So there was several of these .
Recorded Voice : Tick , tick , tick .
NJ : It worked , and it &apos;s true .
This is what it looks like .
So there &apos;s another function on here .
And they text back .
So updates from a beaver .
They &apos;re delicious .
But they also have a chelating agent in them .
Thank you .
I &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot;
The construction began in 1837 .
It lasted about five years .
This is the same tunnel .
This is a German bunker .
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques .
It was not very comfortable .
Thank you .
The soil is extremely good .
But it starts a conversation .
Enough of all that .
We &apos;re starting to build resilience ourselves .
So , back to the public meeting .
Sales were up .
This is a movement for everyone .
Across age , across income , across culture .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s true .
This is some more images of it .
She thought I &apos;d gone off my head .
Cast it in bronze . &quot;
And they have different properties .
One . Great . Okay .
So it &apos;s like the equator or the lines of longitude .
Does someone want to guess ?
Zero . Very good .
There is , there &apos;s a third alternative .
This is what it looks like .
This is the drawing .
How could they see this ?
And the lines look curved .
And it &apos;s a straight line .
Their answer was interesting .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;d like to start with a short story .
They were gone in an instant .
And so this is not a video .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I &apos;d like to thank the wizards here .
David .
Let &apos;s give them a hand .
Thank you .
How dare we be optimistic ?
And we have one .
What is missing is a sense of urgency .
This is the winner .
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
But it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
We have the technologies .
We now have a culture of distraction .
We have the capacity to do it .
You have no idea .
&quot; Now , even lower emissions ! &quot;
Use the Internet . Go on the Internet .
AG : Thank you . Thank you very much .
Sometimes we spread out .
I see you .
Well , this is what they are .
And humans do the same thing .
They do this .
They raise their hands like this .
I notice a couple of things about this .
One , you &apos;re not going to be surprised .
It seems to be related to gender .
So here &apos;s one .
A couple more .
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-power poses .
This one is very low-power .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
Eventually I graduated from college .
I am an impostor .
You are going to fake it .
So she had changed .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
So this is two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
Thank you .
I &apos;m in entertain , amaze mode .
And they were very closely associated .
And let me show you .
Of who else there is , of the history and so forth .
So this is the leading killer of women .
So it &apos;s a woman &apos;s disease now .
And then physicians have gone to bat .
We &apos;ve done the research .
Women are living longer than ever .
And she wanted to study the Talmud .
She had to impersonate a man .
And here &apos;s what the story is .
And they &apos;re just passed .
And our colleagues in Washington , D.C.
Horrible chest pain .
So what do you think happens to these gals ?
Where do women get fat ?
All over .
So we said , &quot; Let &apos;s look at these . &quot;
Panel B is the woman , very smooth .
She &apos;s just laid it down nice and tidy .
So that was a discovery .
Now what are the implications of that ?
And that is microvascular obstruction .
So those are the consequences .
That &apos;s all stem cells .
So this is not a zero-sum game in anyway .
Okay , so here &apos;s where we started .
We are bending the curve .
We &apos;re bending the curve .
Now are we happy with this ?
So we &apos;re 35 years behind .
And in fact , it probably won &apos;t .
But we cannot stop now .
Too many lives are at stake .
So what do we need to do ?
And women do fundraising .
Women participate .
And it &apos;s political .
So thank you for your attention .
So , next I went to London .
But this is that attempt .
There is many different aspects to free-diving .
And then there is static apnea .
That was the one that I studied .
You blow in and out ...
You do that , you get lightheaded , you get tingling .
And you have these awful headaches .
His name is Tom Sietas .
I &apos;m six foot one , and fat .
I was completely wrong .
I had failed on every level .
So , I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night .
So , it &apos;s like base camp Everest .
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it .
Which was making me more nervous .
And I was getting more nervous .
It was a waste of O2 .
There was no way for me to do it .
So , I started to really get really paranoid .
I started feeling pains all over my chest .
It was awful .
And I started having ischemia to the heart .
It would skip a beat .
And then suddenly I hear screaming .
I &apos;m like &quot; Yeah ? &quot;
I was like &quot; What ? &quot;
And that &apos;s my life . So ...
The exception was Japan .
It has happened across the world .
But there &apos;s no major difference .
It &apos;s the other way around .
Just look what they have done .
You need to have children to survive .
These are rounded numbers .
It &apos;s inevitable .
That is needed .
Thank you very much .
That &apos;s 300 million years per minute .
It was taken in 1965 .
And yes , the red planet is red .
This is 2,000 miles across .
We call this crustal magnetism .
Is there water on Mars ?
Here are some recent images .
This is from Spirit and Opportunity .
So , this is frozen water .
This is ice water on Mars .
It has not been seen publicly .
Very intriguing photograph .
Well , we have an idea .
Why is methane important ?
It was a Tuesday .
There aren &apos;t many craters .
But look in the southern hemisphere .
There &apos;s a model of ARES here .
This is a 20-percent scale model .
In two words , very carefully .
This is how we do it .
Main engine start , and liftoff .
It enters the atmosphere of Mars .
A parachute opens up to slow it down .
The thermal tiles fall off .
The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time .
It unfolds .
The rocket engine begins .
Practice makes perfect .
This is a half-scale model .
This is a high-altitude helium balloon .
We &apos;re ready to go .
I have a scale model here .
Thank you very much .
So what do I have to do ?
We don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
Deny .
Sad picture .
Return of fish men .
Refugee camp in Darfur .
I feel ashamed .
My family ... What can I say ?
Thank you .
After many people said I couldn &apos;t do that .
You come from elsewhere .
We talk without lying .
Forty crucial questions .
The name of the movie is &quot; Home &quot; -- &quot; Maison . &quot;
Water resources are running low .
Intensive farming is depleting soils .
The climate is changing .
So what are we waiting for ?
The film is going to be distributed free .
This film has no copyright .
Let me tell you something .
Merci beaucoup . I love you .
They don &apos;t wear shoes . &quot;
They don &apos;t have any shoes yet . &quot;
He sounds something like this .
And the 10-year-old , on every eight notes .
He said , &quot; I was so moved .
And your children are playing instruments .
Then there &apos;s another group , bigger group .
That &apos;s the second group .
Now comes the third group .
So nobody is tone-deaf .
The tone-deaf people , they &apos;re no longer here .
All right . So I &apos;m going to take a piece of Chopin .
So he does it again .
Now , he tries the E again . That chord doesn &apos;t work .
Now , he tries E again , and that doesn &apos;t work .
And then finally ...
Now that is something .
How would you talk ? How would you be ?
And you know , I have a definition of success .
Thank you , thank you .
It &apos;s a great pleasure to be here .
This is a place called Monkey Hill .
This is a guy called Juanderson .
It was boring .
He employed 200 people .
They &apos;re places like this .
That &apos;s where Maureen went to school .
It &apos;s not to do with electricity or water .
It &apos;s the mobile phone .
This is a private school .
What do they look like ?
You can go to places like this .
I was literally pushed to school .
You need to pull him .
What does that ?
These things , they teach through .
Masses of peer learning .
That &apos;s one city .
Here , there isn &apos;t really an option .
And there will be no mistakes . &quot;
There are two basic types of innovation .
It &apos;s an amazing thing .
But it will also lay waste to imagination .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Whole arm . Shoulder disarticulation .
You know , had efferent , afferent , and haptic response .
We put this thing together .
This weighs 6.9 pounds .
Going to scratch his nose .
It &apos;s got 14 active degrees of freedom .
They don &apos;t give any instructions .
She &apos;s a matriarch .
The anternet is coming .
I don &apos;t have the results yet .
It &apos;s very simple .
Thank you .
That &apos;s what he said .
All of us ? Designers ?
Oh , oh , Dad . Oh , Dad .
The song is just a given .
The original tune ? It &apos;s a little scary .
Anybody ? &quot;
Or I &apos;d dress up really , really sharply or something .
Look at that !
Now ... look at , look at this ! Look at this !
No ! They &apos;re not for safety .
No , no , no , no , no .
Acting with intent .
It conveys authorship .
It suggests that someone is driving .
It &apos;s reassuring ; people are drawn to it .
Someone making the experience their own .
People respond to that .
It &apos;s a completely different domain .
Intent is a marker for civilization .
Well !
He came out of nowhere .
Man , I love that thing .
I could afford that .
What was going on then ?
What shall we do ?
That won &apos;t do .
That won &apos;t do at all .
He goes , &quot; Hey , mister ! Mister ! &quot;
You &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
And I went , &quot; Oh my God .
Daddy , this one &apos;s for you .
There &apos;s the former Soviet megalomaniacs .
Now , he really loved to issue presidential decrees .
He was a slightly unusual guy .
There &apos;s Teodorín Obiang .
And there &apos;s Dan Etete .
But it wasn &apos;t about blood diamonds .
He used shell companies .
And then there &apos;s Dan Etete .
So how did that happen ?
And here &apos;s the thing .
It &apos;s too complex and difficult to change .
So this is change happening .
This is progress .
Thank you .
It was an evening dive .
It was breathtaking .
It &apos;s got a built-in flashlight .
And we were very , very happy .
It &apos;s a magical place .
It &apos;s clearly undisturbed by us .
Thank you .
And I was fascinated .
Let &apos;s take a look at some numbers .
It would really boost the economy .
So that &apos;s true love , right there .
They are called neurons .
And so , here you go .
Yes , so that &apos;s the idea .
Thank you .
Thank you .
We were a little bit rattled .
These are baboons at a watering hole .
And that &apos;s when they ran into trouble .
This is actually one of the rangers .
Thank you .
These are the displacement maps here .
Here is the specular component animating .
And thank you very much .
Clouds .
They get a bad rap .
I saw an article the other day .
Right ? Or maybe the opposite .
Perhaps you &apos;re having a moment of existential angst .
What would that mean ?
Those are common clouds .
These clouds form in the region of mountains .
It &apos;s good for your soul .
Thank you very much .
And I can &apos;t complain about this .
And so I sold out way too young .
And I would do it for nothing .
I was not going to say no .
And thought , what are these ?
And I realized , this is it .
We were not playing in L.A. on the regular &quot; Jeopardy &quot; set .
Watson does not travel .
Watson &apos;s actually huge .
And so Watson does not travel .
And I remember thinking , this is it .
I felt obsolete .
And it hasn &apos;t been the last .
I &apos;m not an economist myself .
There &apos;s so much information out there .
There &apos;s just too much .
Who do I vote for ?
Quite probably not .
That &apos;s often the advantage of time .
I &apos;ve met a lot of them .
Thank you very much .
Right . So what has changed ?
They had none of that .
But it didn &apos;t stop there .
Now just think about that .
How did this happen ?
Something is up in Pakistan . &quot;
The bad news is there is no fire brigade .
Example number two : Wikipedia .
I am not making this up .
I &apos;m not taking sides .
And it &apos;s one after the other .
The person said , &quot; No , that &apos;s fine . &quot;
It &apos;s a brilliant idea .
It &apos;s a bee that , yes , flies .
The truth of the matter is otherwise .
The voice says , &quot; Go away . &quot;
We know it all .
We have access to it all .
Jung may have called it &quot; the subconscious . &quot;
What is the imagery of God ?
I love this .
And so there you have it .
I was excited .
I study this .
Why does this matter ?
And some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
So that &apos;s the bottom line .
We short-change ourselves .
It comforted her .
And we &apos;re vulnerable .
It doesn &apos;t face death .
It doesn &apos;t know life . &quot;
And we are vulnerable .
We are not so much in control .
But it &apos;s time to talk .
Start thinking of solitude as a good thing .
Make room for it .
Do the same thing at work .
Change that .
I &apos;m optimistic .
We have each other .
They need us .
Thank you .
What do I mean by that ?
And that &apos;s where texting comes in .
It &apos;s a very natural sense .
No one &apos;s laughing .
Susan : &quot; lol , I see it . &quot;
This Julie says , &quot; So what &apos;s up ? &quot;
It &apos;s used to change the scene .
There &apos;s a lack of structure of some sort .
You can go even further back .
It &apos;s very simple .
That &apos;d be the second thing .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Is E.T. out there ?
This thing — whoops , can we go back ?
Hello , come in , Earth .
There we go . All right .
I have 12 of these .
They &apos;re not building transmitters .
We &apos;re not a miracle , okay ?
You &apos;ve heard about it .
There &apos;s a second way though , as well .
Education .
Old-fashioned classrooms suffer too .
Not so good , is it ?
That is not good for you .
To you and me , that &apos;s a heart attack .
Two and a half thousand pounds .
And that &apos;s free out of that conference .
Let &apos;s broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities .
We have urban planners .
Where are the urban sound planners ?
Where are the interior sound designers ?
I love that phrase .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s my beautiful baby .
It &apos;s the knock-out .
This is what we want .
So we got started .
I want to make the world a better place .
How is this a hard problem ?
Mom &apos;s visiting her kid .
In fact that sounds kind of dumb .
They &apos;re inexpensive , really rugged .
And here &apos;s what we developed .
It only fits a single baby .
You think it &apos;s funny .
Thank you .
Bill Joy : What I &apos;m worried about , what I &apos;m excited about
Vaccines that are broad spectrum .
Vaccines that we can manufacture quickly .
Cocktails , more polyvalent vaccines .
Thank you .
Customer : Uh , let &apos;s see .
Server : Coming right up , sir .
Your food will be served shortly .
And thus , &quot; Malicious Dishes &quot; was born .
Thank you .
Ideas can spark a movement .
Thank you , and peace and blessings .
Thank you .
Please , Mr. and Mrs. Penn . Would you just -- Ah !
I have chosen not to rock the boat .
A verbal response would not be appropriate .
Who is God in all this ? &quot;
And I am among them .
It is not God that I do not accept .
In the process of evolution .
In change and development and growth .
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know .
In awareness of the inner conversation .
Namaste .
Thank you .
This baby is fully electric .
YB : Thank you .
I love stories . I want to read . &quot;
Look for it . Have you noticed it ?
How very wrong I was .
See it up there ?
It &apos;s a blind computer .
It had a speech synthesizer .
I didn &apos;t have to be nice to people !
I no longer would be censored .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s shrunk to .
I can keep up with my friends .
Ron McCallum : Isn &apos;t that slow ?
Can we play that one ?
Do you love being read to ?
In Argentina , there are 50,000 .
I wonder what the future will hold .
I want to thank her too .
I think I have to say goodbye now .
Bless you . Thank you very much .
Yay !
Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay .
And that question is this .
Well , let me first back up for a moment .
This is the rete . Okay . Do you see that ?
That &apos;s the movable part of the sky .
They are just incredibly expensive .
So let &apos;s go to step one .
Deneb is there . I can tell .
Okay , so when that happens everything lines up .
Astrolabes have an incredible history .
They are over 2,000 years old .
It &apos;s just an incredible device .
Every technology advances .
Thanks very much .
But in addition , there &apos;s something else .
B is located on the edge of the network .
And this , in essence , is what &apos;s known as the friendship paradox .
And the difference in the two is 16 days .
Here we are on October the 19th .
And the answer is no .
Just text us your temperature . &quot;
Thank you .
We &apos;re moving .
You &apos;re going it right now .
They &apos;re able to have high levels of writing ability .
You up for that ? Okay .
Five words .
So far so good ?
Just shout it out .
You should have started with Z.
Some people can hang on to five .
Some people can hang on to 10 .
But it does have certain limits .
Do I agree with the assumptions ?
So we need to think about it here .
What we want to do is spin that around .
We need to take advantage of that .
And the last one is support .
Live life . Thank you .
Put yourselves in my position !
There was no motorcade back there .
You &apos;ve heard of phantom limb pain ?
There &apos;s been kind of a series of epiphanies .
We are one .
We all know that it &apos;s Bill .
Let &apos;s find out .
Please raise your hand high right now . OK .
OK , about a -- two dozen .
OK . This is a bit of a problem .
Let &apos;s start at the beginning .
The first one is harm / care .
Here are the results .
Same story for fairness .
But look at the other three lines .
For liberals , the scores are very low .
Of course , Bosch called this hell .
The truth of social entropy .
It really helps to have some sort of punishment .
The Grand Canyon is really simple .
It &apos;s not that complicated .
How did this happen ?
Think about yin and yang .
There are many high gods in Hinduism .
The struggle between for and against is the mind &apos;s worst disease . &quot;
Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil ?
Step out .
Think about the Dalai Lama .
Thank you .
It seems quite vexing .
But nobody did .
That &apos;s not possible .
And so was Darwin .
So we did the math .
What about us ?
How did we get here , then ?
In two words , we cook .
Thank you very much .
Keep it quiet please . Settle down .
It &apos;s about time . End sequence . Take one .
15 seconds studio .
&quot; I don &apos;t know , guys .
I don &apos;t want to get in trouble . &quot;
&quot; Okay . One bite . What the hell ? &quot;
So much for promises .
And moderate on present-hedonism .
Thank you so much .
The cat came and went through an open window in the van .
And I sweated .
Food rotted in the heat .
You should too .
And I cried .
Because I was a writer .
I was a writer .
And I started writing again .
I was no longer homeless .
And I was no longer invisible .
And I &apos;m a very small part of this .
Don &apos;t overdo it . &quot;
And here &apos;s the problem .
Some of the ideas are strange .
These are complaints choirs .
It &apos;s not just competitive , it &apos;s also caring .
Thank you .
I cut stories .
So my process is very straightforward .
And my daily language is English .
It &apos;s all if .
It would be so light .
Here it &apos;s &quot; CandyCity . &quot;
&quot; ModiCity . &quot;
&quot; ElectriCity . &quot;
&quot; ReefCity . &quot;
&quot; A Web of Time . &quot;
&quot; Chaos City . &quot;
&quot; Daily Battles . &quot;
&quot; FeliCity . &quot;
&quot; Floating Islands . &quot;
And at one point , I had to do &quot; The Whole Nine Yards . &quot;
There is no border in between .
Other people make the opposite trip .
That &apos;s the border .
You have sweatshops in hells .
It &apos;s not autobiographical identities .
I love public art .
And it &apos;s still growing .
I don &apos;t know the stories .
Audience : Yes .
SB : What is it ?
There &apos;s a lot of activity in China .
There &apos;s a lot of activity in India .
as it did in Spain .
Now does anybody know who this is ?
A-ha !
Audience : Orkut .
Do we have any ?
I &apos;ll explain it in a second .
And these are all of his friends .
Don &apos;t really pay attention to them .
Raise your hands .
Thank you , Sergey .
And , you know , thank you .
So thank you .
Some of those reforms have been good .
Some of them have been not so good .
They pay me to teach a lesson .
The kids should learn it .
She said , &quot; That &apos;s just a bunch of hooey . &quot;
You ever thought about that ?
I taught a lesson once on ratios .
I &apos;d taught the whole lesson wrong .
And it was difficult . It was awfully hard .
One of the students said , &quot; Really ? &quot;
You just have to strut . &quot;
I was somebody when I came .
I am powerful , and I am strong .
I deserve the education that I get here .
And they said , &quot; Yeah ! &quot;
A student missed 18 .
I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
You made it work for me .
It &apos;s the connection . It &apos;s the relationships .
But it is not impossible .
Thank you so much .
I could accept that .
And of course , they were right .
All of these things .
And it is , to prevent rickets and so on .
It arises in the skin .
It &apos;s not the heart . What do you do ?
And I then moved back to Edinburgh .
So these are kind of sunlamps .
I &apos;m not sure exactly how much .
So , thank you very much indeed .
We have no suspects . &quot;
So I wanted to do things differently .
It impacts everything .
It impacts sentencing .
And it looks like this .
I don &apos;t .
Some people call it data science .
Thank you .
And this problem is : where are the plants ?
Why ?
This is not the common man .
The &quot; Homo studiosus &quot; -- the studying man .
But it &apos;s something completely wrong .
Let &apos;s have a look at this short movie now .
Let &apos;s see .
This is a very fast movement .
But they are also able to sleep .
This is one , Mimosa pudica .
It &apos;s a kind of vegetarian experimentation .
They communicate with other plants .
This is a serious business .
This is not a metaphor .
They work in the same way .
Well , thank you for your attention .
Thank you .
Liu Bolin : The invisible man
This piece is called The Studio .
Kenny Scharf &apos;s graffiti .
There is no Photoshop involved .
Thank you .
Global warming fun .
Digital scrotum , digital media .
4 am in the morning .
You cannot use this picture .
It &apos;s called the Arab Spring .
Anyone heard of it ?
It actually got harder .
The answer is no .
And the transformation continues .
Thank you .
I have a suggestion .
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lecture .
You can just call it out .
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
Who else ?
Peter : The greatest benefit to all .
That &apos;s Peter ?
That &apos;s all right .
It had to do with golf .
They said , &quot; No .
And how many would not ? How many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
All right , we have a good division of opinion here .
What would be your reason ?
Yes , all right .
What &apos;s your name ?
Charlie : Not in my book , it isn &apos;t .
What would you say ?
What &apos;s your name ?
Warren .
Warren : I am not a golfer .
And what do you suppose they all said ?
What do you suppose they said ?
Seven to two , they ruled .
Here &apos;s how he put it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thanks . Thank you .
Chris .
Thanks , Chris .
Michael Sandel . Thank you so much .
We can do that .
This much , right ?
There &apos;s the one that cuts itself .
Let &apos;s hear it . Shake . Louder .
Audience : Shake .
Joe Smith : Your word is &quot; fold . &quot;
Audience : Fold .
JS : Again .
Audience : Fold . JS : Really loud .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
JS : Okay . Wet hands .
Tri-fold . Fold ...
Dry .
Audience : Shake .
Fold .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
JS : Cuts itself .
If you think this isn &apos;t as good ...
Audience : Shake . Fold .
It &apos;s way too big a towel .
Let me tell you a secret .
And you get half a towel .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
And next year , toilet paper .
Raise your hand . Yeah ?
And then they shot him .
You &apos;re welcome .
The price of energy dropped .
The next mayor came along .
And there we were .
And I weighed 220 pounds .
I thought , &quot; What a stupid website . &quot;
And then I &apos;d do it again .
Our city is very spread out .
And so people live far , far away .
Land &apos;s cheap .
The grandchildren are coming home .
This one I thought I &apos;d show you .
So that &apos;s what we call the misguided missile .
It branches on more the experimental side .
There &apos;s the improvisational side of jazz .
There &apos;s the heavy-hitting sound of rock .
You &apos;ve got to do what you want to do .
Is that very common ?
You can skip the dust part .
So let me go on the next short video .
Okay , we have parachute aligned .
Camera . We have a picture right now .
Yeah !
What is he doing ?
What is that ?
CE : Not too bad .
We &apos;re 70 miles above the surface of Mars .
It probably gets about room temperature .
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart .
And that would be bad .
So , we &apos;re 99 percent of the way to where we want to be .
It &apos;s very similar to what you do when you design your product .
And then we back off , you know , from that point .
And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist .
It &apos;s real stuff .
Now , &quot; The Lord of the Rings &quot; has two things played through it .
We saw geysers coming out .
So this is a Yellowstone , you know , of Saturn .
So thank you very much .
I see some nodding heads there .
In reality , take a guess .
And so this is what I did .
Well the range is quite a bit .
This is Nell Remmel .
And this is 22 feet long .
And I love to dig a hole .
And this piece is &quot; Frost . &quot;
The sun rises , and it melts away .
And that was played by my mom .
One of these is scratch-off masterpieces .
He draws sticks real good . &quot;
Which is one of the best compliments ever .
This project is called &quot; Love Nests . &quot;
And this one &apos;s called &quot; Lovelock &apos;s Nest . &quot;
This one &apos;s called &quot; Mixtape Love Song &apos;s Nest . &quot;
And this one &apos;s called &quot; Lovemaking Nest . &quot;
And this one had to get broken up .
That &apos;s my mom and dad .
This is by Jason Birdsong .
And he plays with this idea .
So he pairs these up .
There &apos;s another pile of leaves .
Those are actually all real butterfly specimens .
But it &apos;s actually a painting .
So that &apos;s what she did .
And that &apos;s the symbol of their culture .
And this is called &quot; Horse Sense Fence . &quot;
She heals with color .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thanks .
Thank you . Thanks .
Compassion has many faces .
They are not luxuries .
And early in the morning , I went into the ward .
I looked into her face .
I looked up .
They touched me at that time .
She had phenomenal strength .
And there are various facets .
It is there within every human being .
The very word terror is global .
This is called resilience .
And that is the mental quality of equanimity .
Step back , give your mother a break , okay .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m out of here . &quot;
He &apos;s going down the path .
He sees something in the path .
The wound is just filled with maggots .
Thank you .
This is normal science .
Very Zen-like . Whoo .
We &apos;re not smarter now than they were then .
And the same thing about tectonic plates , you know ?
It can attack . It can do all kinds of stuff .
Now , in evolution , what happened ?
I have this thing called the altered door thought experiment .
And that &apos;s because you &apos;re making a prediction .
So what will brain theory look like ?
Not like computer memory . It &apos;s not at all like computer memory .
No doubt that it &apos;s going to happen , in my mind .
The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain .
That wasn &apos;t being asked .
The cancer was too advanced .
I brought some for her parents .
She was fat .
I &apos;d like to say I don &apos;t know .
But I actually do .
You treat the obesity .
Cause and effect .
I &apos;d like to tell her how sorry I am .
Good afternoon .
Now a laser is different .
I have a Ph.D in molecular biology .
It &apos;s sure to help .
It doesn &apos;t actually do what it says on the tin .
We &apos;ve got to practice what we preach .
So 3 , 2 , 1 .
Very good .
We &apos;re all victims of terrorism .
There was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there .
The son &apos;s dead . The father lives .
What they &apos;d have done then is an invasion .
It &apos;s human nature .
They &apos;re not just going to be smart .
Why was it effective ?
The last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue .
The advantages of dialogue are obvious .
There &apos;s practical problems .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s changed my life .
Walk the talk .
Thank you .
After all , what constitutes a world leader ?
But , the fact still is that it &apos;s not just that .
She can &apos;t understand the dialogue .
That &apos;s the Indian story .
We &apos;ve got all of that .
We can &apos;t really be both of those .
Thank you very much .
I almost lost it this week .
Matt Berlin : Hello , Leo .
Leo , this is Cookie Monster .
He &apos;s very bad , Leo .
He &apos;s a scary monster .
He wants to get your cookies .
It turns out it &apos;s the same for robots .
The first was just the screen .
It could make eye contact with you .
And then it could help track that for you .
What if -- Nathan : Here it comes . Yay !
But I want to do more than that .
Thank you .
Likewise for hearing .
Okay , play that video please .
Mother : That &apos;s an owl .
Owl , yeah .
Owl . Owl .
Yeah .
Baby . Baby .
You want it ?
If we could play this video please .
JN : Yeah .
JN : I see . And who is that ?
It comes in handy .
Girl : No .
Music is entirely different .
Now if we could just play this .
Go ahead and play this one .
That &apos;s kind of hypnotic .
The trumpet .
And the second one .
That &apos;s a violin .
Go ahead and play that .
And yes , there is hope .
This is ... does somebody know ?
This is Beethoven .
The brains remain hardwired for music .
And it was absolutely wonderful .
You don &apos;t actually have to hear it .
And I want to thank you for your time .
This is my grandfather .
And this is my son .
These are my buildings .
That &apos;s a wonderful thing .
That &apos;s the change .
Fair enough .
And the way I describe it is this .
That &apos;s how much it takes .
Thank you .
And I &apos;m still on that mission .
And it hurts your throat .
The simplest way to do it is something like this .
By dancing . It &apos;s like this .
Thanks .
And now , a rockabilly guitar .
So that &apos;s cool .
Impossible , you say . No .
Why do this ?
Like this .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
I love to do synthetic biology .
I love things that are alive .
Is biology special ?
Is matter evolvable ?
So here &apos;s some inorganic life .
This is an inorganic tube .
And this is dead .
Now , that &apos;s a bit boring .
And this is really the question .
Well what about matter ?
But what does a cell do ?
And from this stuff we came .
And here we are .
I say , &quot; Well I want molecules . &quot;
Carbon is banned .
And that is the key .
And that &apos;s really worth thinking about .
Evolution cannot be cut apart .
You &apos;re sitting on chairs .
Thank you very much .
Just a quick question on timeline .
When ?
That would be a big story .
He stood over six feet tall .
I am thinking of your love for me .
I am torn by your love for me .
Goodbye , my love , goodbye . &quot;
It &apos;s way below your cognitive thinking process .
It &apos;s below your emotions .
You lose your sense of self .
You can &apos;t stop thinking about another human being .
Wild is love .
What a bad deal .
How , you know , what have I lost ?
He said , &quot; The god of love lives in a state of need .
It is a need . It is an urge .
It is a homeostatic imbalance .
Like hunger and thirst , it &apos;s almost impossible to stamp out . &quot;
And I just simply say , &quot; Hardly . &quot;
And I said , I don &apos;t know .
These are two women .
Here &apos;s why .
So what then ?
Thank you .
We invent .
And we do that for a couple of reasons .
So we made this thing .
It vends out little individual vials .
We &apos;ll move on to malaria .
Or you could spray .
You can give drug administration .
How can you tell ?
We picked Madagascar .
And this is this latter part of the rainy season .
This is a real ad .
The United States did .
They &apos;re completely natural .
They &apos;re the only ones that are dangerous .
Would you like to see it ?
Audience : Yeah !
We have the device over here .
Take it away Eric .
This is very satisfying .
Here &apos;s another one . Bang .
Take a look at this picture .
I &apos;ll bet Nelson has a cellphone .
So here is the puzzle .
Now , in a word , the answer is &quot; rules . &quot;
What kinds of rules ?
In particular check out Asia .
Zoom in on Haiti , in outline here .
We &apos;ve got to find ways to build up , as well .
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel , printing , gunpowder .
But then in the late &apos; 70s something changed .
One is : preserve choices for people .
The city can be built .
You start from uninhabited territory .
They want to get out .
Why don &apos;t you , Canada , take over ?
Allow a new city to be built up there .
Allow many people to come in .
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well .
Take this representation of all of the land .
Their kids can get an education .
How would we finance this ?
Let me conclude with this picture .
And he was right , of course .
Let &apos;s start with aviation .
Or take healthcare .
And innovation is disruptive .
But let me stress two things here .
But now let &apos;s take a step back .
They &apos;ve created jobs .
They &apos;ve raised living standards .
But this is not a foregone conclusion .
Thank you .
Think about what you might pick .
There is another spike visible at 22 .
But they lose , right ?
So they &apos;re smart , but poor .
There &apos;s almost no difference .
Okay . Get ready .
This is a bargaining game .
That &apos;s kind of a mistake together .
There &apos;s a lot more arrows .
Wrong .
They &apos;re also very obsessed with status .
Now we move the payoffs .
Thank you .
But here &apos;s what I learned .
But that is not the case at all .
I go by the data . &quot;
And the data is very clear .
And that part of it has not changed .
And nothing happened at all .
Thank you .
Ridiculous , right ?
I mean , it &apos;s crucified .
I mean , I love the stuff .
Yes , sure .
Not a lot of people are doing it .
And for good reason .
Natural foie gras .
And it &apos;s shockingly not a new idea .
Big , big problem .
He said it sort of gleefully .
It was all over the papers .
Huh , amazing .
Couldn &apos;t find a shred of evidence .
Now , look at the guy .
Amazing .
He kept going like this to me .
I figured it out .
I was speaking too loudly .
So I hushed my voice .
And he stopped doing this .
Right up to us , like right up to here .
Right along the fence line .
He rewired it . He invented it .
He doesn &apos;t .
He electrifies only the outside .
Why ?
Now , what happened ?
The landscape is incredible .
I mean , his farm is incredible .
It really is the Garden of Eden .
Extra difficult . Extra hard .
Upgrades the life for these geese .
He doesn &apos;t care .
Part of the income for his farm .
A big part of his income for his farm .
That &apos;s how I &apos;ve been trained .
Or they were .
And the geese love the Lupin bush .
Radioactive yellow .
Bright yellow .
It was never him .
&quot; Shush , &quot; he says again for the 500th time to me .
&quot; Shush , watch this . &quot;
And this squadron of geese come over .
And then they circle around .
And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese .
&#91; Clapping &#93; And the wild geese are calling down .
And I &apos;m just saying , &quot; No way . &quot;
No way .
And he says , &quot; No , no , no .
They &apos;ve come to stay . &quot;
They &apos;ve come to stay ?
He said , &quot; No , no , no .
To happiness .
They find it here .
They don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
Think about that for a minute .
It &apos;s brilliant , right ?
So how did it taste ?
It was incredible .
I &apos;m really in love with him at this point .
It was sweet , it was unctuous .
I was sure of it .
But I can taste things .
And he says , &quot; No . &quot;
But no .
What ?
He doesn &apos;t need salt and pepper .
How come no one &apos;s really heard of you ? &quot;
And he was right .
He was right .
Simple .
I really was moved .
And I wrote , insult to history .
It &apos;s like , why didn &apos;t I follow up on that ?
What the hell does that mean ?
Insult to history .
The history of foie gras .
Jews invented foie gras .
True story .
True story .
By accident .
Gotten sick of the chicken fat .
The Pharaoh got -- I swear to God .
And they invented , what ? Gavage .
Supposedly , anyway . I believe that one .
That &apos;s the history of foie gras .
That &apos;s also an insult to history .
It &apos;s rooted in extraction .
Take more , sell more , waste more .
And he &apos;s right .
Really new .
That &apos;s serendipitous .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve been in Afghanistan for 21 years .
We do more than that .
There was so much to learn .
It was a strange sensation .
It &apos;s something that comes out from the past .
And the orthopedic center was closed .
And everybody disappeared from the street .
The cars disappeared as well .
I ducked .
&quot; I work , &quot; he said .
Why don &apos;t you have the artificial legs ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; The Red Cross has closed . &quot;
We will provide you with a pair of legs . &quot;
Who is going to make the legs for him ? &quot;
So I hoped that he would not come .
And I spoke with a gatekeeper .
Nothing can be done .
Give him some money . &quot;
And they were not alone .
And there was some staff too .
I said , &quot; No .
It &apos;s not a priority . &quot;
It &apos;s really dangerous .
But they insisted .
He was telling me , &quot; Patients are coming . &quot;
And Mahmoud was coming every day .
Very sad , dark .
Everybody was grabbing something .
And we ran .
Dignity cannot wait for better times .
He was in good shape -- a bit thinner .
I asked about his son .
He told me , &quot; He &apos;s at school . He &apos;d doing quite well . &quot;
So I asked him , &quot; What is that ? &quot;
He was sweating .
And he was standing in front of me , his head down .
He said , &quot; You have taught me to walk .
Thank you very much .
That was the job .
&quot; My children are growing .
I feel ashamed .
I said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
Just to give him some money .
It was the easiest way .
And then he sat down .
&quot; What ? &quot; I said , &quot; Stop . &quot;
We need to increase the production . &quot;
&quot; Excuse me ? &quot;
I could not believe .
I said , &quot; Listen , it &apos;s insane .
And it &apos;s even cruel to think of anything like this .
That &apos;s a production line and a very fast one .
I can &apos;t believe it . &quot;
The production was up 20 percent .
&quot; It &apos;s a trick , it &apos;s a trick , &quot; I said .
And then I asked for verification .
It was true .
I understood that I was wrong again .
Mahmoud had looked taller .
So of course , I understood .
And you know what ?
It &apos;s good for everybody .
But also for the newcomers .
Sometimes you see them , they look , &quot; Oh . &quot;
Scraps of men do not exist .
They are my teachers .
This is my big wish .
Is it really necessary ? &quot;
Well now you should see me .
And what did it start ?
I came back in &apos; 86 .
Is it that I articulate very well ?
Is it that I analyze the data very well ?
It must be the same .
You cannot discriminate .
Look at this picture .
Anybody ? Any guess at all ?
Pardon ?
We should be doing something about it .
You must have taken tea in the morning .
Think for a minute .
And what has happened ?
It all begins with curiosity .
And this is what he got painted .
Look at this .
And she &apos;s so marvelous .
Look at what she has done .
Look at this .
It &apos;s a tawa .
Look at what he is doing .
I had to meet my love .
Even love needs help from technology .
My technology .
My technology .
And this is a donkey cart which they modified .
She said , &quot; Change your profession . &quot;
Products have gone to the market , a few .
Thank you .
And the answer is : Yeah , it can .
That &apos;s the difference .
The green represents the percentage .
See that again .
This is the challenge .
That &apos;s not that hard .
Use of freshwater .
What &apos;s green carbon ?
More of that in a minute .
Well I &apos;m afraid not .
Thank you .
And to you , everyone , thank you very much .
What &apos;s going on in the U.S. government ?
So that was the 20th century .
The bad news , however , to this question of will evil prevail , is that evil lives on .
Let me be clear .
The recovery &apos;s going to take some time .
He negotiates with the Serbs .
Well , I &apos;d like to separate the sheep from the wolves .
What do you do ?
You &apos;re un-owned .
And it doesn &apos;t have to be an act of weakness .
He saw them .
Thank you .
That &apos;s not a bad size home .
How large is that one portion of a mine ?
It &apos;s carcinogenic . &quot;
Thank you so much .
Hold on .
Girl in Phone : Hey , where are you ?
You were great .
Let &apos;s play a game .
Three cards , three chances .
Now where &apos;s the lady ?
Where is the queen ?
MT : This one ?
Sorry . You lose .
Well , I didn &apos;t deceive you .
You deceived yourself .
Self-deception .
They believe they can win .
The brain is very good at forgetting .
Bad experiences quickly disappear .
That &apos;s &quot; Clair de Lune . &quot;
Thank you . Thank you very much .
It is questions .
We &apos;re fishing at the low end .
But really it means excellence .
It tries to affect people .
Do we stop there ?
I don &apos;t think so .
as Michel Foucault puts it .
And with that , I thank you .
It &apos;s all right .
The World Wide Web ? Not so sure .
What is this ant doing ? What is this in aid of ?
Well then , why is it doing this ?
Is it just a fluke ?
Pretty scary .
No , it &apos;s worse than that .
Justice . Truth . Communism .
They &apos;re infectious .
It was a term of abuse , in effect .
So , this is mine .
Unmistakable .
But it &apos;s everybody &apos;s idea now .
And he &apos;s not responsible for what I say about memes .
I &apos;m responsible for what I say about memes .
But it is a problem .
Not silicon .
What &apos;s a word made of ?
Simple , beautiful furniture ?
And they could keep it going .
It &apos;s part of their plan .
I &apos;ve not time to go into more of it .
They are wiping out languages .
They are wiping out traditions and practices .
They &apos;re like a mild cold .
They &apos;re not a big deal for us .
And we should be very alert to this .
This is not the place for hate and anger .
Get the facts .
Work out the implications .
You will never annihilate the germs .
Thank you .
Thank you .
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere .
So , it &apos;s a bit of a curve , that .
India , the world champions .
But was India ready for it ?
But take a look at this .
Can you imagine ?
Are they grain ?
Are they cattle ? &quot;
There it is .
One and a half million dollars for six weeks &apos; work .
That &apos;s not bad , is it ?
Thank you very much . Thank you .
I can see I &apos;ve got my work cut out for me here .
A questionnaire .
That was a really good time .
They took pictures .
Can you read it ?
My measurements .
It is all about passion .
People like all of you in this room .
They only make good former spouses .
I looked like a refrigerator .
I don &apos;t know .
She &apos;s pregnant and a widow .
Two tiny little boys .
I know them well .
They have no education and no freedom .
The year is 2005 .
Women are 51 percent of humankind .
I want to make this world good .
Thank you .
I got the data .
It &apos;s just basically two strands .
It &apos;s a mystery , it &apos;s magic , it &apos;s divinity .
Then you start to take a look at adult life .
Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries .
I mean , and only one mile is visible .
Thank you .
School &apos;s almost over . Summer is near .
I &apos;m ready and willing . I &apos;m packing my gun .
He was coughing , crying , blood spilled on the street .
Thank you .
&quot; Yo &apos; wack .
Boards don &apos;t hit back .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot;
And I got distracted by it .
I bought a fast car .
It didn &apos;t help .
But money can &apos;t buy happiness . &quot;
And clients didn &apos;t call .
And that was great .
But it wasn &apos;t a quick trip .
It took seven years .
It &apos;s a continuous journey .
So here is to your continued success .
Thank you very much .
Paper maps are becoming obsolete .
&quot; I already have , &quot; she replied .
So , there we were .
They get drowned out by the bubble .
And why is that ?
It might be deadly .
So is this really possible ?
Well , the short answer is yes .
And &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
Thanks .
This is Tamdin .
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala , India .
This is Paldin .
And this is a little girl .
This is another leader of his people .
And Moi is 35 years old .
This is Mengatoue .
I wish they would just go away .
Thank you very much .
Gotcha .
Mosquitos . I hate them .
Don &apos;t you ?
But that &apos;s fascinating , right ?
And the answer is smell , the smell of her body .
And there &apos;s a whole range of compounds that they do use .
They had a very strong preference for biting on the face .
That &apos;s right .
And you know what ? It worked .
That &apos;s the cheese , just to show you .
They &apos;re all together there . They are immobile .
Ooh , that was very quick .
Yeah .
Thank you .
Here we go .
There we go . Okay .
So let me show you a little of that .
So it started over here .
&quot; Where were you October 5th ? &quot;
Furniture that I can &apos;t fit in my ratty apartment .
I was like , &quot; Great . &quot;
I work at a university .
I was like , &quot; No . &quot;
So they &apos;re looking at me really odd .
And it &apos;s like , &quot; Guys , I travel a lot . &quot;
This is with the FBI .
And there was a sincere concern there .
Just wanted to say , &quot; Hey guys .
with pictures , with travel tips .
Then I &apos;d make websites .
But I &apos;ll watch myself . It &apos;s okay .
And I &apos;ll help you out .
This is in Warsaw .
And there &apos;s a verification taking place .
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee .
Sometimes there &apos;s a lot of information .
And then sometimes you get this .
I spend a lot of time on the road .
So there &apos;s multiple databases .
And there &apos;s thousands and thousands and thousands of images .
So you get something like this .
These are some of the meals that I &apos;ve been cooking at home .
So again , you have to do some detective work here .
It &apos;s actually quite user-unfriendly .
And you know very little about me actually .
Well you have to take control over it .
And we &apos;re getting to that .
Because no one &apos;s really watching .
No one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot;
Because it &apos;s about surveillance .
I &apos;m watching who &apos;s watching me .
And I came up with these .
So these are some of my sample logs .
Central Intelligence Agency .
Executive Office of the President .
So how many hours of the day does that take ?
HE : Almost none .
It &apos;s no different than checking an email .
So it &apos;s just become another day .
And everything &apos;s automated at the other end .
So it holds onto the very last point .
Joseph Nye : Global power shifts
Now that &apos;s a big abstract number .
Anybody can play in the game .
The State still matters .
But the stage is crowded .
by 2027 .
First of all , it &apos;s a linear projection .
The answer is it matters quite a lot .
Let me give you an example from history .
What caused it ?
No , I think that &apos;s wrong .
It &apos;s bad history .
Power is multi-polar .
It &apos;s one in which we can all gain .
Now I don &apos;t mean to be Pollyannaish about this .
Military power is important .
Keeping balances is important .
All this still persists .
Thank you very much .
They &apos;ve been around for decades .
So you &apos;re probably all wondering : the cave .
Did you find the gold ?
Thank you .
But let &apos;s be frank .
Now I want to step back a bit .
&#91; &quot; Chair &quot; &#93; Orange , good . &#91; &quot; Table &quot; &#93; Green .
&#91; &quot; Board &quot; &#93; Audience : Red.Daphne Bavelier : Red .
Yellow or blue ?
A bit more challenging , right ?
That &apos;s the chocolate side of the equation .
Einstein : Einstein .
E : Hello .
E : Woo .
SW : Yeah .
E : Achoo !
E : Ooh .
Little splat at the end there . Einstein , did that hurt ?
E : Ow , ow , ow .
Can you get down ?
She &apos;s going to make me do it , too . Ooh , ooh .
Einstein : Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
E : Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
Einstein , can you also sing ?
E : La , la .
E : What &apos;s the matter ?
E : Yar .
E : Beer .
You like to drink water .
What do you say to a good-looking man ?
E : Hey , baby .
E : Yee haw .
E : Happy birthday to you .
SW : Good job !
E : Woo , woo , woo .
E : Tweet , tweet , tweet .
SW : And the penguin ?
E : Quack , quack , quack .
SW : There we go .
Let &apos;s get that one out of there . How about a chimpanzee ?
E : Ooh , ooh , ooh . Aah , aah , aah .
SW : Very good .
What about a wolf ?
E : Ooooowww .
SW : And a pig ?
E : Oink , oink , oink .
SW : And the rooster ?
E : Cock-a-doodle-doo !
SW : And how about those cats ?
E : Meow .
E : Grrrrr .
SW : What about a skunk ?
E : Stinker .
E : Superstar .
E : I &apos;m special .
E : I love you .
E : Goodbye .
So ideas change states .
We thought of people as a liability .
The next thing is technology .
And really there are four things here .
One is the question of education .
The third thing is again cities .
It &apos;s very difficult to start a private university .
The second thing is , the health issue .
And that makes a huge difference .
Thank you very much .
Isn &apos;t amazing ?
And that is really amazing .
It can even change you .
And everybody can do it .
Thank you .
I was born and raised in North Korea .
I was four years old .
But that is no way to survive .
I was not uncommon .
That hope kept me alive .
Hope kept me alive .
I was 16 years old .
I didn &apos;t even go to middle school .
I was so happy .
I looked at him sitting next to me .
Hope brought me to America .
Thank you .
And I -- oh , gosh .
AH : Sure , please .
Thank you .
Sleepy Man Banjo Boys : Teen wonders play bluegrass
TM : Thank you , thank you .
Robbie Mizzone : Thank you .
TM : Thank you .
JM : Thank you all .
TM : Thank you very much .
It grows every year .
The average age of gamers ?
Well , no , actually it &apos;s 30 years old .
All video games are violent .
Online gaming statistics .
What do you think these people are doing ?
At some point something clicked .
I know I can .
We are interacting with our entertainment .
DP : Wow .
Who is that going to come from ?
I don &apos;t think so .
You &apos;re off , you &apos;re off . That &apos;s it .
He &apos;s out of time .
You know , we have the technology .
So , my closing thought .
Thank you .
And Grandma was even more excited .
Let me , let me push the button . &quot;
She was mesmerized .
Look , the homes are full of machines .
And they want the washing machine .
And no one raised their hand .
Here we are .
And they also have electricity .
First , population growth .
Second , economic growth .
So what needs to be done ?
It &apos;s real .
They love them .
The machine will make the work .
And she also got books for herself .
Thank you steel mill .
Thank you power station .
Thank you very much .
And so began industrial fishing .
So what did we find ?
That &apos;s a question for the future .
Now in terms of the unknowns , there are many .
So we &apos;ve done pretty well .
And as the oceans go so shall we .
Thanks for listening .
That &apos;s the good news .
50th percentile female frame .
I told them they &apos;re nuts .
They &apos;ve been watching too much &quot; Terminator . &quot;
Seems like that would be an inconvenience .
I cannot do that .
His wife was standing behind me .
So , can we see that ?
This is a non-trivial thing to do , by the way .
&quot; Well , would it help if I ... &quot;
You could see he was missing an arm .
So , he wouldn &apos;t say much .
And he made a few comments .
he has no legs .
So , we left .
They &apos;re not finished giving yet . &quot;
It was astounding .
So , we went back .
We &apos;re screaming along .
He &apos;s got no legs .
He &apos;s got no arms .
He had one good eye .
His name is Brandon Marrocco .
&quot; You &apos;ll get them . &quot;
&quot; Sure . &quot;
He doesn &apos;t really want a lot .
So , I was on my way out here .
I said , &quot; What am I going to say ?
&quot; You need to come . &quot;
So , I went .
&quot; Who is entitled to what ?
Who is entitled to how much ?
Who is going to pay for it ? &quot;
Those are tough questions .
There are other questions that are tough .
&quot; Should we be there ?
How do we get out ?
It is an easy answer .
And we ought to give it to them .
I &apos;m kidding .
And I &apos;ve got malingering .
And I said , &quot; How ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Who &apos;s Tony ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Hardly anything .
So I said , &quot; Yes , please . &quot;
And the patients started drifting in .
And he sat down .
Fake madness .
It &apos;s just impossible . &quot;
He was a psychopath .
So I did .
Who cares ? That &apos;s not a big story .
And they didn &apos;t reply .
And he said , &quot; Come on over . &quot;
There were lions and tigers .
He was taking me through the garden .
There were falcons and eagles .
It was like Narnia .
And I said , &quot; A psychopath . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Manipulative . &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s leadership . &quot;
He &apos;s only ever been married twice .
It &apos;s what all journalists do .
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m not a psychopath . &quot;
Will you come to it ? &quot;
So I said okay .
So I went to his tribunal .
So they let him go .
Nothing bad happened .
And then he phoned me .
Thank you .
: ... extremely dangerous questions .
This is bad ?
What will that lead to ?
We &apos;re all in this together .
It &apos;s just beginning .
Can you imagine ?
It is something to be greatly optimistic about .
My background is not exactly conventional medical training .
It &apos;s not ancient history .
And we had to start all over again .
Thank you very much .
And I believe the answer is yes .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t know .
That doesn &apos;t interest me .
I call that the cynical design .
The big challenge in front of us .
Voice offstage : Four point five .
Fantastic ! It &apos;s a beauty !
And this territory is fantastic .
Something like that . I am not sure of that .
We can say that .
I can explain you . I shall try .
You , you survive . It &apos;s OK .
Nobody &apos;s obliged to be a genius .
It &apos;s very , very , very important .
It &apos;s OK . We are in the light .
There is different type of barbaria .
That &apos;s why we must adapt .
You must go back to fight , to battle .
Because it &apos;s not the right time .
We have just to finish the story .
That is very , very important .
And you can fall , and it &apos;s very dangerous .
We give you white pages . Invent .
So , I &apos;m an artist .
And it just takes a quick , quick second .
Thank you .
The universe is really big .
It &apos;s extremely beautiful .
So we say the universe is expanding .
That kind of makes sense to us .
In particular , things were a lot denser .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
So that &apos;s our job .
We learned that it &apos;s accelerating .
The universe is not only expanding .
Well what is the implication of that ?
It &apos;s very , very unlikely .
But there will also be large fluctuations .
But he was not right .
And Feynman also understood this .
It &apos;s cooling off .
They will fall into black holes .
The future is much longer than the past .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
Why aren &apos;t you ?
Thank you .
And for the musicians .
Pianist transforms to violinist .
William Kamkwamba : Thanks .
Where ? What country ?
OK . Now , you &apos;re 19 now ?
WK : I wanted to make a windmill .
A windmill ?
WK : Yeah .
WK : Yeah .
WK : Yeah .
And you made it out of what ?
OK .
WK : Yeah .
WK : Yeah . I test .
What materials did you use ?
WK : Yeah . The windmill .
How much electricity ?
WK : 12 watts .
Wow .
WK : Yeah .
WK : Yeah .
WK : Yeah .
How big ?
WK : Yeah .
Thank you so much for coming .
WK : Thank you .
So we call this Anatomage Table .
I &apos;m going to do some cuts .
Then it &apos;s going to show inside .
You can see some internal organs .
So we call this the slicer mode .
OK , I &apos;m going to do another cut .
Right there .
This shows a lot of internal structures .
Like this .
Right here .
OK .
Let &apos;s say I &apos;m interested in looking at the heart .
Oops ! ...
Okay .
All right then .
Let me zoom in .
I &apos;m going to make a cut right there .
And then you can see the inside of the heart .
Yep .
Maybe I can add quickly this way .
It &apos;s a female now .
I would say , &quot; Would you die for him or her ? &quot;
And , indeed , these people would say &quot; Yes ! &quot;
It can be focused on nobody .
Women can talk .
They &apos;re highly imaginative .
And -- basic math !
Anyway .
It may decline some more .
They are seeping around the world .
I would recommend it .
Everybody knows that .
So now -- -- thank you .
They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And , &quot; Wasn &apos;t that rickshaw driver handsome ! &quot;
Thank you .
And the ice that is there is quite thin .
These are the tuna , the billfish and the sharks .
They also get entangled in fishing gear .
So I think the message is clear .
Thank you very much .
These clipboards are filled with numbers .
That begins my translation process .
So all the way around , you have a 24-hour timeline .
Thank you .
You should be nice to nerds .
I &apos;m just saying .
I feel a little uncomfortable .
We &apos;re tested .
That was 1903 .
We &apos;ve flown twice .
It can hover and rotate .
It does not eat nectar .
It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it .
Wow .
It &apos;s great .
This is a spider mite .
But it too had humble beginnings .
Sometimes we just forget .
So can you .
You were born to .
He was with our transportation team .
It mattered to me .
And remember , be nice to nerds .
Thank you . Thank you .
I have a couple of questions .
It might be a little warm .
Like what &apos;s the payload it could carry ?
It &apos;s amazing .
The hummingbird ?
Yeah ?
That &apos;s what we do .
Sure .
How do you answer them ?
David Hoffman : What happens when you lose everything
I had a fire nine days ago .
It &apos;s gone .
I cherish the future .
That &apos;s my papers .
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes .
That &apos;s me at my desk .
You know -- all the stuff .
That &apos;s my daughter , Jean .
Idea about women .
The negatives are gone .
That &apos;s my daughter and me .
That &apos;s my house .
Thank you everybody .
So what &apos;s going on here ?
What about animal testing ?
We &apos;re in constant motion .
Our cells experience that .
And I have one right here .
And it &apos;s not just beautiful .
It can do a tremendous amount of things .
We &apos;re not trying to do that here .
We have three fluidic channels .
Let me show you .
It &apos;s pretty exciting .
Yeah . Mucus . Yuck .
We have a gut on a chip .
Now we &apos;re really getting excited .
Does it have a toxicity ?
Does it get cleared by the liver ?
Is it metabolized in the liver ?
Is it excreted in your kidneys ?
Children are not adults .
It &apos;s pretty exciting .
Plug and play . Easy .
So how do we prevent them ?
Personalized medicine . Thank you .
I really believe that .
All of us are makers .
We &apos;re born makers .
We create things .
Apparently it can .
I might get one of those .
We got there first .
Lady : Will you glide with us ?
And of course , we have fashion .
They did that in the summer , and it was very warm .
So , are you a maker ?
And again , think about it .
They &apos;re not mainstream .
They &apos;re a little bit radical .
And I found this old video .
This is Andrew Archer .
He liked to take things apart .
And that &apos;s why he moved to Michigan .
Let me say that again : playing .
It &apos;s a micro-controller .
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
Fascinating work they &apos;re doing .
An the answer to the question : what will America make ?
It &apos;s more makers .
Thank you very much .
&quot; I destroy lives , &quot; mum said .
I love her , you know .
The devil is in me , Court .
Court : Sleep .
Have you ever been ?
Court : Where ?
Nigeria .
Court : Never .
Wish I could .
Court : I don &apos;t want to get rid of you .
You don &apos;t need me .
Boy : What do you do all day ?
Marcus : Read .
Boy : Don &apos;t you get bored ?
Marcus : I am retired .
Boy : So ?
Marcus : Because I do what I like ?
Boy : Yeah .
Marcus : A modern day poet .
Boy : Yeah , you could say that .
Marcus : So what do you talk about ?
Boy : What &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
Boy : Reality , man .
Marcus : Whose reality ?
Boy : My fuckin &apos; reality .
Marcus : Tell me about your reality .
Marcus : With an AK-47 ?
Marcus : The Panthers .
Boy : Panthers ?
Épuise , right ?
Woman 1 : Yes .
Director 2 : Can you not shut up ?
Let &apos;s go .
W1 : They suck .
They suck ? What about yours ?
What , what , what , what about , what ?
What the fuck are you talking about ?
You make people fuckin &apos; sleep .
Dream about bullshit .
What happens with that ?
Onicha : Yes , mama .
You must get -- ?
Child Soldiers : Ready and willing to die .
CS : The barrel of the gun !
C : This is the gun .
CS : This is the gun .
Amphetamines .
Witness : We walked and walked for two days .
We didn &apos;t eat .
Without food -- I was sick .
God will forgive us .
Ezra : I don &apos;t remember .
Various Voices : You will die ! You will die !
The Mende sons of bastards .
Who is she ?
Me .
Why you giving these to me ?
My story is a little bit complicated .
I &apos;m interested .
Mariam is pregnant .
Big mouth . Short legs .
I take you are preparing a major attack ?
This must be the mine .
Your girl is here .
Well done , well done .
You are planning to go back to fight are you ?
The beginning of hope .
CC : Yes , correct .
E : So you too must stand trial then .
Our government was corrupt .
CC : No , we don &apos;t .
E : You are richer than us .
No .
You are not on trial .
E : Then let me go .
CC : I can &apos;t do that , son .
E : So you are a liar .
Thank you .
That &apos;s really my thinking .
N Thank you .
EO : Thank you .
The converse is also true .
It &apos;s a challenge to our ingenuity .
So this is how this scheme would look .
The next thing is sodium chloride .
And this is an important point .
Thank you .
We grew up , and we grew older .
I went to high school .
I graduated .
Life was pretty good .
2007 was a great year .
I spoke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p.m.
on a Sunday night .
And it was a really heavy time .
And nobody read it except for my mom .
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger .
So let &apos;s talk about those three As .
The second &quot; A &quot; is Awareness .
They &apos;re in there .
The last &quot; A &quot; is Authenticity .
He loved knitting .
That &apos;s what he said .
So those are the three A &apos;s .
I was eating olives with pie .
And I &apos;d say , &quot; I don &apos;t believe that . &quot;
And he &apos;s like , &quot; I don &apos;t believe it either .
We &apos;re the only ones with jewelry and democracy .
We &apos;ve got fashion magazines , house party scenes .
And that &apos;s the sad part .
Thank you .
Have you ever wanted to write a novel ?
So I did .
It &apos;s awful .
Thanks .
And Bertie County is no exception to this .
The county seat is Windsor .
There isn &apos;t even a Walmart .
This is the most complex .
And this is what it looks like .
This is Ryan .
She is 15 years old .
And then this is Anthony .
Thank you .
First , a video .
And yet , look around us .
So let &apos;s do it .
Around us , there &apos;s nothing .
There &apos;s not even time or space .
It &apos;s incredibly hot .
And this is how it works .
Now , the going gets tougher .
What are the Goldilocks conditions ?
But not too little .
Why ?
Each rung contains information .
So the information spreads .
Let me explain why .
But it is so slow .
It &apos;s what makes us different .
But it also contains warnings .
I thank you for your attention .
Good afternoon .
My name is Uldus .
Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric .
And what about me ?
I &apos;m 27 years old .
Be brave . Be ironic — it helps .
They are commissioned .
Thank you so much .
This is how war starts .
Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation .
It stops .
Great person .
I learned about compassion .
I learned so much about myself .
They don &apos;t get their money out .
I have to report it . &quot;
All I am is a witness .
Thank you very much .
Well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
I -- was -- your hand go up ?
How about a two-digit number ?
Audience : 22 .
Audience : 47 .
No .
OK , great .
Audience : 25 .
Audience : 37 .
37 squared , OK .
Audience : 23 .
23 squared , OK .
Audience : 59 .
Audience : 93 .
529 .
529 .
3481 .
3481 .
8649 .
Thank you very much .
Audience : 987 .
Yes ? Good .
Audience : 457 .
205,849 ?
Yes ?
Audience : 321 .
Audience : Oh , 722 .
Yes .
Audience : 162 .
Thank you very much .
Audience : Nine .
Nine .
Audience : Seven . Seven .
Audience : Five . Five .
Audience : Eight . Eight .
Yes .
Thank you very much .
Does yours go higher ?
Oh -- yours does ?
I can probably do it .
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
How many digits do you have , six or seven ?
Seven , and yours ? Seven .
Seven ? Seven ?
And , uncertain .
Yeah .
44875 .
079044 .
OK , any six of them .
263972 .
Thank you very much .
What year ?
Audience : 1953 .
1953 , and the month ?
Audience : 23rd .
OK , it &apos;s -- how about you , what year ?
Audience : Fifth .
Audience : February .
Call -- call -- what year was it ?
Audience : Yes .
Thank you very much .
We can do it that way .
I brought with me a book of calendars .
What year was it , first of all ?
Audience : 1966 .
1824 .
1824 , OK .
Sixth -- was that a Sunday ?
Good , thank you very much .
Audience : Five . Five .
Audience : Seven . Seven .
Audience : Six . Six .
Audience : Eight . Eight .
Audience : Three . Three .
57,683 squared . Yuck .
Now , let me recap .
Thank you .
Let me explain what that is .
Audience : Yeah !
Good .
Thank you very much .
And clearly , I wasn &apos;t starving .
Well , nothing .
Nothing .
There were no cell phones then .
But he didn &apos;t .
I woke up the next morning .
And I did .
I &apos;m not kidding .
But loneliness doesn &apos;t .
Failure does that as well .
You need to be .
And I said , &quot; In the front seat . &quot;
So now he thought I was on drugs .
You have to gain control over the situation .
Rejection is extremely painful .
His cancer was extremly aggressive .
But I knew what to do .
All the tumors were gone .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s got 90 degree corners .
So here &apos;s what we did .
I &apos;ll zoom in a little bit .
It is essential for success .
It &apos;s called &quot; being true to yourself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
I am used to no choice . &quot;
and then hop across the pond to France .
What do they do ?
Thank you .
Thank you .
And I can &apos;t decide .
And one was called &quot; Ballet Slippers . &quot;
And the other one was called &quot; Adorable . &quot;
&quot; Okay , great . &quot;
&quot; What does it look like ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a glamorous shade of pink . &quot;
What &apos;s different about them ? &quot;
Okay , we got that .
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon .
&quot; No . No . No one is in charge .
It organizes itself .
You would be wrong .
The first day they all came back .
Seventy percent of the population didn &apos;t want this .
Well , think about it this way . Who changed ?
They &apos;re not even aware of this themselves .
Thank you .
And this is what it is .
This region right here is the reactor .
Their burn-up is much higher .
Carbon-free electricity .
So I &apos;m really excited .
So thank you guys .
Well , we certainly try .
There is a rash of suicide in China .
But this does not follow any of the usual trends .
And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation .
People have also wanted to deconstruct .
That &apos;s nonsense .
And it starts in the ventral tegmental area .
It wouldn &apos;t eat . It wouldn &apos;t sleep . It wouldn &apos;t have sex .
It wouldn &apos;t do anything but press this bar .
It gives objects what &apos;s called incentive salience .
And we see here the smile .
Here is a three-week-old baby .
It &apos;s sort of &quot; me , &quot; not &quot; we . &quot;
And that &apos;s really mediated by the sex hormones .
Romantic attraction , that gets into the desire system .
But the effect is relatively small .
So we have here , this couple .
Then do what you have to do . &quot;
Thank you .
And I was like , &quot; Sure . &quot;
Inside your heart a voice is calling .
Go get it , girl .
It &apos;s just incredible .
She started singing her song .
Thank you .
We have really no idea .
And the answer is : all of them .
That &apos;s the definition . There was no temperature .
Differences , freedom , choices , possibilities .
That &apos;s what technology really wants .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
That &apos;s what technology wants .
Thank you .
A couple of examples .
Look at that .
Thank you .
I could get access to it .
They checked schedules . They were meeting with secretaries .
And they will step up .
And I said , &quot; Go read it . &quot;
They will not disappoint .
The next phase it hit was displacement .
Start with gene sequencing .
And you &apos;ve seen the numbers .
Thank you .
JR : One year of turning the world inside out
You are going to take the photos .
You &apos;re going to send them to me .
This is Inside Out .
This is the size .
This one was from Haiti .
Boom ! This is what happened .
Karachi , Pakistan .
And he &apos;s here also today .
People , energy , make the glue , organize the team .
It was amazing .
Education is so essential .
It &apos;s everywhere .
Thank you .
Of course , in the challenge there is a prize .
So you go to the literature .
How do you do this ?
What would you do ?
What experiments would you run ?
Wow .
The leg is acting as a foot .
The foot is distributed along the whole leg .
How do they do it ?
Take a look at what that is !
Watch it go over this .
Really simple , but beautiful .
And my assistant &apos;s going to help me here .
Did you notice something ?
Boy : Spiny .
How does it do it ?
This is really , really difficult .
But look at this animal do it !
Watch its feet .
Did you touch it ?
I did .
So it &apos;s pretty tough to do .
These are its feet .
Here you are , pulling off the Band-Aid .
And here is RiSE .
And that &apos;s exactly what he &apos;s done .
Thank you .
I call this hypersonic sound .
Sound , light : I &apos;m going to draw the analogy .
Hasn &apos;t changed that much .
Light came out of it in every direction .
That &apos;s the way loudspeakers pretty much are .
I have a couple of units .
Too many other smart people out there . So .
I &apos;m not at all against education .
Isn &apos;t that terrific ?
Pain is 120 .
We &apos;re using very short wavelengths .
Turn it on ; turn it off .
If you haven &apos;t heard it , raise your hand .
Getting it over there ?
Get the cameraman .
Yeah , there you go .
Thank you once again .
Appreciate it very much .
Fight back ? Give in ?
Use more force ?
And my mother came up and said , &quot; What on Earth are you doing ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to Budapest . &quot;
And she said , &quot; What on Earth for ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Don &apos;t be so silly . &quot;
And I started to cry .
You &apos;re much too young to help .
You need training . I &apos;ll help you .
But just unpack your suitcase . &quot;
So what does work ?
When do I give in ?
What will I stand up for ?
They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns .
But she told the students to sit down .
And no one got killed .
But we have to practice .
So what about our fear ?
I have a little mantra .
You &apos;re the adult .
The fear is the child .
How can this be made better ?
And you make a plan .
Half-past seven , we &apos;re getting up and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . &quot;
So I did the thing .
Totally ineffective .
They are human beings just like us .
This century there &apos;s a shift .
They know best what to do .
And complete silence fell .
Now that to me is wisdom in action .
You don &apos;t believe me ?
And this hasn &apos;t just happened .
It &apos;s flown around the world .
I don &apos;t have to believe in it .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t have children .
I &apos;m Gever Tulley .
This is five dangerous things .
Thing number one -- play with fire .
This is like one of the great things we ever discovered , fire .
Number four -- deconstruct appliances .
So , let &apos;s see .
Mentions of polar bears drowning : four percent .
So you &apos;re going to be able to go like this .
He was talking about morality .
OK .
All right .
First of all , it needs to be small .
Lightweight . Portable .
Uses very , very little power .
Very , very high resolution .
And broadly applicable across many platforms .
We start . This is day one .
Day two .
Day three .
Day four .
Day five and day six .
&quot; Free Bird . &quot;
Satan . Satan . Satan .
For example , in cheese sandwiches .
Is it the Virgin Mary ?
OK .
Can we cue the music please ?
And all the trees have turned brown .
Thank you very much .
No hope of describing that .
It involves gravitational waves .
What about Africa ?
It &apos;s still going on .
And we got lots of applicants .
And that &apos;s really exciting .
And I &apos;ll just show you one .
I have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree .
So I &apos;m happy she &apos;s here .
And she &apos;s now at AIMS .
It won &apos;t be easy .
Thank you .
Zoom into it and see where it was taken .
So you can open this one .
So this shows ...
And it works the exact same way .
You can pinch into any page .
Open it up .
Thank you .
What is the business here ?
All right . Mike , thanks so much .
MM : Thank you .
But really , it &apos;s pretty robust .
What about real people ?
So how do we deal with this ?
And how do we do the positive control here ?
Well , it &apos;s pretty simple .
That &apos;s me , getting a nasal lavage .
Day zero : nothing happening .
So , that &apos;s great .
So , we built out the chip .
All this white stuff -- it &apos;s not good .
She could no longer breathe for herself .
What to do next ? Don &apos;t know .
You &apos;re looking at her open lung biopsy .
There &apos;s just a little bit of it sequenced .
OK , that &apos;s one case report .
But now it &apos;s a door .
Thank you very much .
So we turn to the field of vaccines .
That &apos;s a pretty hard act to beat .
I share that view .
It &apos;s a spring-operated device .
So it does that well .
It &apos;s getting more systematic .
That &apos;s a challenge .
Thank you .
and she said , &quot; Probably never . &quot;
Thank you .
So it can &apos;t be true . &quot;
They do it to make a profit .
It was mind-blowing .
And I want to be very clear .
We needed medicine .
Here &apos;s the reality .
Capital purchase items .
These young boys are in Nepal .
And it can be done .
In fact , it &apos;s peanuts .
It &apos;s just not going to happen .
Okay , thank you so much .
Now that is foreplay .
And so they still weren &apos;t getting it .
And they said , calcium carbonate .
We &apos;re done . You know , I &apos;ve seen that island .
How does life make things ?
Life can &apos;t afford to do that . How does life make things ?
How does life make the most of things ?
That &apos;s a geranium pollen .
In other words : structure .
The two groups are not talking to each other .
At all .
This is Sandia National Labs .
That &apos;s a sea sponge that has a fiber optic .
Healing : this is a good one .
I &apos;m not going to get to 12 .
Thank you .
Janine Benyus : Oh really ?
That &apos;s the twelfth one .
We know what they are .
Why ?
In winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
How is that possible ?
You think of carbon as black .
We &apos;d have to see at night , right ?
This lets you do it .
Transparency is key .
And then I &apos;m going to turn the lights out .
What if we combined it with this ?
It &apos;s my energy .
We &apos;re simply not going to do that .
It &apos;s been a long time in coming for me .
By any standard this is wrong .
It &apos;s just wrong .
We can do better than this .
We should do better than this .
You don &apos;t have enough time .
Thank you .
Yes , I have a team .
And we &apos;ve been on a journey .
But the journey itself was worthwhile taking .
And now we &apos;re there .
It &apos;s difficult to swim in .
And the hypothermia sets in .
It &apos;s gorgeous .
It &apos;s just -- So , uh , wooo .
That &apos;s the everyday machinations .
To be is to do .
Yeah .
Thank you .
Bonnie , where are you ?
Where are you ?
There &apos;s Bonnie Stoll .
My buddy .
Thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Find a way !
I bet you &apos;re worried .
I was worried about my own vagina .
She was busy ; she didn &apos;t have time .
I am worried about vaginas .
This is how the &quot; Vagina Monologues &quot; begins .
Thank you very much .
And that tells us several things .
And that &apos;s the key : it &apos;s about power .
Is there a stage director ? &quot;
The power is in the system .
What do the people bring into the situation ?
What does the situation bring out of them ?
Gets it right , reward him .
And then the next step is another 15 volts .
Continue , teacher . &quot;
Five kids had emotional breakdowns .
The key is in the red zone .
And that &apos;s the power of anonymity .
Mindlessly taking the first small step .
That &apos;s the Lucifer effect .
For three years , they were in hiding .
I just came to my senses , obviously .
And you &apos;re on one side or the other .
The key to heroism is two things .
He &apos;s got a reason not to get involved .
So the point is thinking it and then doing it .
Thanks so much .
Power .
That is the word that comes to mind .
How much power do we have ?
Let &apos;s take an example .
I know if you &apos;re good to give a loan to .
What &apos;s the right thing to do ?
Fair enough .
But it brings me back .
Which one is it ?
How should we figure it out ?
Uh huh .
Next question , a little bit harder .
Or should we leave him alone ?
Collect his data .
Leave him alone .
You &apos;re safe . It &apos;s fine .
Kant .
Mill .
Not as many votes .
Yeah , that &apos;s a terrifying result .
What &apos;s a moral operating system ?
Plato , that &apos;s right .
Remember him -- old philosopher ?
He was worried about right and wrong .
He wanted to know what is just .
It &apos;s kind of convincing when he talks and when she talks too .
Favorite number . I love that number .
There are truths about two .
They all have two-ness in them .
And therefore , it &apos;s not a matter of opinion .
That &apos;s a stunning vision .
He wants objective truths .
He thought it was impractical .
But don &apos;t give up .
That sound familiar ?
Let &apos;s take an example .
He has autonomy .
It doesn &apos;t matter what the calculations are .
It &apos;s not a matter of calculation .
So let &apos;s stop .
So let &apos;s cut to the chase .
How should we be making our decisions ?
What &apos;s the formula ?
There &apos;s not a formula .
There &apos;s not a simple answer .
Ethics is hard .
Ethics requires thinking .
And that &apos;s uncomfortable .
But they can &apos;t .
We &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
It arises from not thinking . &quot;
So let &apos;s do that . Let &apos;s think .
Or now we have a few more choices .
Are you ready ? Go .
Stop . Good work .
Do it over lunch .
It &apos;s based on Norse legend .
That &apos;s interesting .
And we care about right and wrong .
We &apos;re the ones writing this opera .
This is our movie .
Thank you .
Herbie Hancock : Thank you .
Marcus Miller .
Harvey Mason .
Remember this .
This is what keeps its promise .
Spring .
Imagine designing spring .
This happens every year .
There is lots of showing off .
There is lots of love in the air .
And he came up to me and he knocked .
And we looked at it together .
It was so architectural . It was so precise .
And they &apos;re focusing on function .
It doesn &apos;t do it with a chemical .
It &apos;s self-assembling .
It &apos;s waterproof .
It &apos;s strong and resilient .
Nature is nano .
Nature has been doing that for a long time .
Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers .
Dr. Adam Neiman .
Thank you very much .
Genital stimulation . Duh .
It &apos;s so sad .
It &apos;s like this . You trigger the spot .
I said , &quot; You should actually do this . &quot;
Nothing seemed to help .
It was called the &quot; upsuck &quot; theory .
They didn &apos;t buy it .
And they masturbated .
This one involves men .
Okay .
And I got a copy of this DVD .
So uh , okay .
Now here we go in to the -- la la la , off to work .
It all looks very innocent .
And the happy result .
I love this video .
So we thought , let &apos;s not mention the clitoris right now . &quot;
They tend to -- pigs , for example , are more like dogs .
And the woman would have sex with it .
Yes . Exactly .
Thank you very much .
Thanks !
So what &apos;s image got do with it ?
And you know , it &apos;s amazing .
Just think about that , you know ?
We start with poverty .
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs .
They talk about corruption .
I missed the cutoff by one point .
And my father said , &quot; OK , listen .
Final story , and I sort of have to speak quickly .
Disease .
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis .
The first time he got sick , he recovered .
You know , so money ran out .
He got sick again .
And that kept him going .
But the money ran out .
How would you look at me ?
With pity , you know . Sadness .
This is the damage it causes .
But it &apos;s damaging .
And I &apos;m not unique , right ?
And you didn &apos;t know about the windmill , you know ?
And I was just moved .
And this is , again , the point I &apos;m trying to make .
So , what is to be done ?
It only has five contributors .
What are we doing ?
The cheetah generation .
No , you &apos;re not .
You know , just jump .
The continent needs you .
And I can &apos;t emphasize that enough , you know .
And because I &apos;m needed here , you know ?
But there is such a need , you know ?
We &apos;re now moving into East Africa .
What are they doing ?
And how can we change that ?
Where do we go from here ?
It &apos;s not that easy , you know ?
I was helping her pay her tuition .
I was paying her school fees .
You know , she &apos;s now my baby sister .
So , don &apos;t underestimate that .
I said , &quot; I want to be a lawyer . &quot;
It was like , &quot; Where do you want to go ? &quot;
And , you know , so he took me under his wing , and he encouraged me .
And this is just an illustration .
Thank you .
Four hundred aluminum cans .
Strings attached to dancers .
It &apos;s wavy .
Let me show you one more .
Thank you very much . Thanks .
Thanks .
I like working with my hands .
RM : Thanks .
For example , molecular structure .
Because it is hard to make symmetry .
And so what is symmetry ?
And what about the triangle ?
But now this has some reflectional symmetry .
The Rubik &apos;s Cube .
Of course , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
It still ends up at half a turn .
It &apos;s almost like little Sudoku tables .
It will make you immortal .
You &apos;ve overestimated .
How many digits are there in your number ?
21 is the closest .
So , what is your name ?
You are now immortal .
And it comes in a male form , too -- very glamorous .
A magazine ?
Well , it &apos;s certainly not this one .
There &apos;s the glamour of physics .
And there is , of course , this glamour .
You had &quot; a &quot; glamour .
Glamour is a magic spell .
Why is it glamorous ?
What is it about Superman ?
It makes things look effortless .
Glamour is about editing .
There are no cords .
Is it something important ?
This is from Soviet Union . Attractive .
There &apos;s a glamour shot .
I &apos;m not against glamour .
And that has a fascination .
Thank you .
What I &apos;m here to talk about is the camel .
Pull its tail up ; take a look in there .
Do you want to roll the film ?
And that will turn it into actually usable water .
But there &apos;s a big , fat pad in there that squishes out .
So , what the hell .
We weigh our animals .
Don &apos;t even think about it . Don &apos;t think about it !
Out !
No .
Out !
And so we started thinking .
Can you roll it , please ?
and I &apos;m very well ... hung .
I &apos;m TED Camel .
The perfect desert machine .
Leathery chest pads that beat the heat .
Short fur that keeps my skin cool .
Long legs that allow heat to escape .
And my hump ?
Here &apos;s a hint : Bactarian , Dromedary .
I &apos;m built to last .
I &apos;m powerful .
Able to pack up to 400 lbs .
No surprise .
RW : That &apos;s terrific . Thank you .
Turn and face your neighbors .
Please , also on the balcony .
Smile . Smile . Open the mouths .
Smile , friendly .
Of course not .
Sounds like fast food , doesn &apos;t it .
It &apos;s technology .
Because brains are expensive .
It &apos;s very expensive .
We walked out of Africa two times .
You can continue to innovate and invent .
What kind of criteria did it use ?
Sweet -- energy .
It penetrates the mucosa .
This is fat digestion .
Thank you very much .
He died in 1974 .
Roll that tape .
NK : Did you hear that , really ?
We are proud of it .
NK : You &apos;re proud of it ?
Louis Kahn , yes !
Your father , is he alive ?
Very pleased to welcome you back .
NK : Thank you .
No , he never saw this .
In that way it is so relevant .
NK : It cost him his life .
But he was also human .
You have to understand that .
It also happens to be a relative of parsley .
And back to the yew here .
And what &apos;s more , it &apos;s actually a tree .
It &apos;s a primitive conifer .
Thank you .
Please raise your hand -- oh , that &apos;s a lot .
In the last year ?
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic .
And what it is -- it &apos;s actually steak .
Well , this must be the strangest thing I found .
Thank you very much .
Power was focused at the very top .
And what changed ? Technological innovation .
Gunpowder , cannon .
Representative government began to form .
But time is a factor .
But I think the truth is the exact opposite .
This is no different .
Thank you .
Thank you .
The point about democracy is intrinsic .
It &apos;s a question of what the citizens do .
Thank you very much indeed .
Perhaps build some schoolrooms .
So TACARE is a success .
There is a great deal of poverty .
And these decisions affect Africa .
The earth is poisoning our foods .
We &apos;ve talked about the soil erosion .
All around the world climates are mixed up .
It &apos;s Africa that already is affected .
I asked a question . &quot; Why ? &quot;
We not do have more than this one planet .
Do you really have hope ? &quot; Well , yes .
And I mean , think of the technologies .
What we buy . What we wear .
And an example is the TACARE program .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I talked about spaghetti sauce .
And so many people , I guess , watch those videos .
And he was Swiss .
He &apos;s an engineer .
It &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
It weighs about 50 lbs .
It was like manna from heaven .
And what was God &apos;s will ?
Well it allowed you to do that .
It &apos;s never allowed to be photographed .
First of all , it &apos;s really hard to use -- really hard to use .
Secondly , it breaks down a lot .
There are clouds , right .
Not a lot .
10 percent . 10 percent .
You know what the answer was ?
Zero , not a single one .
Now why is that ?
Or take the battle in Afghanistan .
Well it &apos;s extraordinary .
But do you know what the crucial thing is ?
I &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
But of course , it didn &apos;t matter .
He was a committed Christian .
So this is a soccer game .
So that &apos;s great . So that was too easy .
First , extractive industry .
Second is technical assistance .
We live in one world .
But that &apos;s easily said .
We propose 10 .
I won &apos;t elaborate .
And there are lots of other examples .
It &apos;s just cash .
And that &apos;s the first thing .
Thank you .
Today the world of globalization is on speed .
Time has been compressed .
In our world .
And the Russians , equally .
Abandonment .
That gives me hope .
Second , textile .
With the Put Out system ?
You know , the aid system is broken .
They didn &apos;t want to give us the money .
And it still didn &apos;t work ?
AG : No . It &apos;s not that it didn &apos;t work .
I met humble people .
And I ever met more humble people .
I was alone on foot .
But he gave me a cup of tea .
Thanks .
A recent study in the U.S.
I don &apos;t have the right answer .
One , sit at the table .
And three , don &apos;t leave before you leave .
Number one : sit at the table .
And everyone kind of sat at the table .
I wish I could do that now .
My brother is kind of busy .
You don &apos;t know anything . &quot;
Why does this matter ?
Own your own success . &quot;
But it &apos;s not that simple .
You want to spend the day fishing with him .
But Heidi ? Not so sure .
You &apos;re not sure you &apos;d want to work for her .
This is the complication .
I said , &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
She starts leaning back .
And she said , &quot; Oh no , I &apos;m not married . &quot;
She didn &apos;t even have a boyfriend .
It needs to be rewarding .
Don &apos;t leave before you leave .
Stay in .
They &apos;re just not moving .
I have two children .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a story passed on generation after generation .
I don &apos;t belong there .
Well ...
Al-Batina is the hidden .
She said , &quot; That &apos;s not me . &quot;
Like I care , right ?
That &apos;s not timely .
So if we can get the lights ...
I need more light .
What &apos;s happening ?
Dana : There &apos;s too much darkness .
I can &apos;t forget auntie .
Dana : But I can &apos;t help .
I believe in you .
You are Noora the Light .
Dana : No .
Now , tell me which way to go .
Dana : That way .
Alarm : Threat imminent .
Jabbar : Aaaahhh !
Miklos : Stay away from me .
&#91; &quot; The 99 &quot; &#93; Thank you .
I have work to do . &quot;
True story .
Thank you very much .
Think of a mathematician &apos;s argument .
We want killer arguments .
And you answer my objection .
This guy &apos;s a good arguer .
That &apos;s the bad news .
I don &apos;t have an answer .
So try this .
Thank you .
Hi everyone .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a little quirky and silly .
You can tickle the rug .
You can make the baby poop .
You can burst bubbles .
You don &apos;t like it ?
I have to tell you about my childhood .
Basically , I celebrated every religious function .
It was a very beautiful time .
He &apos;s like , &quot; Huh ! &quot;
I have another idea .
Thank you very much .
Openness alone can &apos;t drive change .
They saw it as thinking .
They can &apos;t think together .
Openness isn &apos;t the end .
It &apos;s the beginning .
I &apos;m a very lucky person .
What an amazing experience .
Lots of snow in which to dig a den .
See what you think .
The tube-lipped nectar bat .
But how to reach it ?
Necessity is the mother of evolution .
KB : What a tongue .
There are so many wonderful places .
It &apos;s freezing cold , and that thin air really gets you .
Have a look .
Dan Buettner : How to live to be 100 +
There is what Oprah tells us .
There is what Doctor Oz tells us .
When it comes to supplements , should you be taking them ?
How about these hormones or resveratrol ?
False .
Your chances are very low .
I love that word .
False .
And it builds up exponentially .
Well , the same things happen to our cells .
It &apos;s called Cannonau .
Just look at the advertisements .
That &apos;s called the grandmother effect .
What do they do ?
It was invented by Confucius .
We &apos;re down to one and half right now .
Their average age is 102 .
This is a heterogeneous community .
None of it &apos;s hard . None of it costs money .
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old .
And then Marge Deton .
Marge is 104 .
She starts her day with lifting weights .
She rides her bicycle .
And we managed to boil it down to nine .
They don &apos;t have any conveniences .
That &apos;s physical activity .
There &apos;s no longevity diet .
It &apos;s actually Bitcoin .
And I find that sort of scary .
So you think about loyalty .
So that brings me back to the connection with sweat .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
It all became music to me .
I didn &apos;t hear the boundaries .
This is slave labor to my own project .
Take piping .
Here &apos;s the first demonstration .
I &apos;m biased .
So no human interaction .
Thank you .
And it &apos;s an African story .
There was Hollywood .
Then came Bollywood .
And I was born in Zambia .
And it really was a place where I learned to walk .
Action .
And you shoot in seven days .
I believe in the power of audiovisuals .
He needs proper medical attention .
It &apos;s the blockbuster comedy .
You &apos;ll crack your ribs .
Just arrest yourself , sergeant .
Don &apos;t embarrass yourself .
Come on . Don &apos;t run away . Come back . Come back .
He influences you really good , you know .
See you . Bye .
Action .
And I didn &apos;t want that , you know .
Let &apos;s go .
Cover this . It &apos;s your own .
Move it .
The masking tape will hold it .
Wat , wait . Just hold this for me .
Action .
Cut .
So many themes in this story .
And I think they &apos;re breathing .
And guess what ?
No stories around the campfire .
No legends , no fairytales .
Nothing .
No novels .
So this is what I really think .
Just a few moments .
Love , action .
Thank you very much .
There is scientific data on this .
2,000 films a year ?
There are challenges . There are challenges .
They can be rented for pennies .
On what format ?
There is no life without stories .
Franco , thank you so much .
That &apos;s pretty ambiguous .
And that &apos;s the whole piece .
That &apos;s about that big .
I &apos;m imagining myself as a machine .
What would I love ?
It &apos;s definitely happy .
And that was that tool .
I just like , throw it in .
So , that &apos;s a finished gear .
It means nothing at all .
So I &apos;ll just let this chair come down .
Thank you .
I have a tough job to do .
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms .
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure .
And this is what we saw .
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall .
I was real surprised .
What could they learn to do ?
So , how do they do that ?
So , they seem to be able to acquire very quickly .
So here are my four sentences then .
Thank you .
I &apos;m not sure if this is going to be good or not .
I &apos;ll just be doing it .
I &apos;m going to start really , really simply .
Yeah ? It &apos;s absolutely there .
So I have to get myself in the zone . Right .
It &apos;s a bit of a cross of my arm .
Going to watch it from the side , whoa .
Strike moment .
That &apos;s it .
Some work very much in specific detail .
Just grab this arm .
Can you rotate ?
Whoom , just go back to the beginning .
Okay , not bad . A little bit more ?
Throw it into the audience again .
Ready and go ... um .
That was the second way of working .
So just keep working on them for a little second .
The one you made .
So -- three versions . Oh .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Here we go .
Hetain Patel : Who am I ? Think again
I have asked her to translate for me .
Okay .
Be formless , shapeless , like water .
It becomes the cup .
HP : Don &apos;t imitate my voice .
It offends me .
I have .
At first , it was going very well .
It didn &apos;t look Indian anymore .
I said , &quot; What ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes . So ? &quot;
This is my art .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Will I be marginalized ?
Will I not make enough money ?
We don &apos;t talk about the sacrifice .
And they &apos;re doing it .
But there &apos;s only one mosque .
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Long story .
What are you saying ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , what are you praying ? &quot;
We need leaders .
Thank you .
I always wanted to be outside the box .
Trillion !
Now , let &apos;s look at it .
Why not ?
What does that mean ?
The normal example , let &apos;s take the human mammary gland .
I work on breast cancer .
They are completely different from each other .
So , what does this tell you ?
So , what do we do now ?
Could this be done ?
So , we tried it .
This is what we got .
There is so much mystery we don &apos;t know .
Curiosity and passion .
Look at it . It &apos;s constantly doing this .
Has a coherent movement .
Absolutely boggles my mind .
So I &apos;d like to finish with a poem .
It &apos;s called &quot; Among the School Children . &quot;
On the right , there is a coral .
So go to it !
Aimee Mullins : Changing my legs - and my mindset
I played softball for five years growing up .
That &apos;s all I &apos;d ever known .
You were all over the place .
He &apos;s just a rather intimidating figure .
And I said , &quot; No , come on . &quot;
Why don &apos;t you just tell them ?
It was really , really hot .
And he just sat there like this .
He kept me on the right track .
AM : No , a year .
And I &apos;m sure of it , you know ?
I wanted to find out times .
AM : Oh , sure .
No , I &apos;ve got so many legs in here .
These are -- do you want to hold that actually ?
AM : In these ?
SS : In these .
AM : Yes , we &apos;ll do that .
SS : Yes , there you go .
They &apos;re also silicon .
I need a little bit off . &quot;
No , these legs are great .
My name is Joshua Walters .
I &apos;m a performer .
They &apos;re just practicing .
Okay ? Mmhmm ?
Some of them committed suicide .
Now recently , there &apos;s been development in this field .
And everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
Everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
Everyone is just a little bit mad .
Thank you .
You know , you don &apos;t have to have a Kwanzaa festival .
This is the other side of the building .
OK .
It &apos;s really incredible .
And that &apos;s how we do it .
You know , that &apos;s not good enough .
We have to do good buildings .
They &apos;re not the same thing .
This is a real school !
It is going to change absolutely everything .
We gotta do better than that !
Some of them we &apos;re going to fix , though .
We &apos;re going to have to do everything very differently .
And America &apos;s not prepared .
Be prepared to be good neighbors .
Consumers are different than citizens .
So thank you very much .
We shall prevail .
So here &apos;s the thing .
So here &apos;s the situation .
We also are going to need political innovation .
And what does that look like ?
At the moment , we still don &apos;t know .
Thank you very much .
We love back-of-envelope calculations .
Okay , so let &apos;s put in some numbers .
And that &apos;s the answer .
Maybe this isn &apos;t going to be quite so easy . &quot;
Countries are different from each other .
But there used to be a whole load of people .
That &apos;s 15 years of progress .
Next , let &apos;s look at solar power .
But I &apos;m also pro-arithmetic .
Of course , Britain doesn &apos;t have any deserts .
Yet .
And a third option is nuclear power .
So that &apos;s some supply side options .
Next , there &apos;s the heating lever .
Here &apos;s a graph I made .
Those people don &apos;t need to be able to write beautifully by hand .
They don &apos;t need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads .
They do need to be able to read .
Or should they not ?
What did the poor do wrong ?
The children came running in .
And I said , &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
I said , &quot; Just like that . &quot;
And I went away .
So I said , &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot;
Here &apos;s a short glimpse from those years .
So I started publishing .
Where does it stop ?
&quot; And anyway , I am going away . &quot;
So they said , &quot; We haven &apos;t given up .
We look at it every single day . &quot;
So I tested them .
Thirty percent is a fail .
So she says , &quot; Absolutely not .
So she says , &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Stand behind them .
So she did that for two more months .
The scores jumped to 50 percent .
Neurons ... communication .
At 12 .
What will it be tomorrow ?
But look at it this way .
What an achievement that is .
There is evidence from neuroscience .
Because it was needed .
If you didn &apos;t , you failed .
They &apos;re called the Granny Cloud .
&quot; Shhh . &quot;
Okay ?
Watch this .
You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me .
Grandmother : Well done ! Very good .
SM : So what &apos;s happening here ?
It &apos;s not about making learning happen .
It &apos;s about letting it happen .
This one is in England .
So what &apos;s my wish ?
It will be called the School in the Cloud .
That &apos;s my wish .
And just one last thing .
I think it was good advice .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you very much . Wow .
It &apos;s grown-ups that get really upset .
Okay .
Now it &apos;s going to head off .
Let &apos;s run this video .
Okay , good .
The robot &apos;s being totally autonomous .
Thanks .
Good robot , that &apos;s good .
So we saw a bunch of things there .
And it looks right at that .
Do you really think so ?
Voice : Look at my smile .
Not appropriate . No . No .
Robot : Oh , cool .
They &apos;re just machines , after all .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen .
He was quite a figure .
Don &apos;t try that one .
But is that really the case ?
And there &apos;s a lot of it .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a rare condition .
They want to ask me something .
I &apos;m an extreme example of this .
One is a flash of white light .
Three is green .
Four is blue .
Five is yellow .
I paint as well .
And here is one of my paintings .
It &apos;s a multiplication of two prime numbers .
64 multiplied by 75 .
What about 75 ?
64 becomes 6,400 .
What do you say ?
Okay .
Some people say it &apos;s happy .
Thank you .
What is it made of ?
And why on earth could that be so ?
It &apos;s fairly dramatic , actually , to have this happen .
We express these things mathematically .
There are lots of more sophisticated examples .
They are symmetries of the sphere .
A whole new symmetry .
Symmetry exhibits the simplicity .
It &apos;s the same theory of gravity .
They are what we call emergent properties .
That &apos;s what emergence means .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s laying dead on its belly .
Both are of the male sex .
And then this happened .
I look . Both are of the male sex .
Homosexual necrophilia .
And here &apos;s the situation again .
And here are the ducks again .
But then something good happened .
That &apos;s the first thing .
Dan , where are you ? Dan Ariely ?
Applause for Dan .
I &apos;m going to pass it around .
Yeah ?
This is a moose .
These are pigeons in Rotterdam .
That &apos;s on June 5 every year .
Thank you .
Oh , sorry .
Thank you .
So how does it work ?
So we have three steps .
He &apos;s coming up to the grandstand , fellow Federationists .
Well there comes the first box .
Mark Riccobono : Yes .
You must be out of your mind . &quot;
And I truly believe that this can happen .
This is priceless .
Thank you very much .
She &apos;s turning it inside out .
Her friend says , &quot; Buy it already . &quot;
Well , yeah .
Canal Street , I know .
Maybe just a little .
Here &apos;s what he had to say .
There &apos;s lots of virtues of copying .
It forced him to be a little more innovative .
Okay , we &apos;ll move on .
This is not unlike the world of comedy .
Who owns a look ?
Same with automobiles .
Hairdos , no copyright protection .
They share their designs .
Jokes , no copyright protection .
It ain &apos;t pretty .
It &apos;s embarrassing . &quot;
Then it deserves protection .
Is it a utilitarian object ?
No protection .
It &apos;s a digital file .
They &apos;re smart .
He &apos;s smart , he &apos;s smart .
Thank you so much .
This is Mass General in Boston .
So let me back up a little bit .
And we wait .
Please go cut that piece out . &quot;
The molecule they had developed had three parts .
Nothing will be specific .
There &apos;s no specificity there .
The molecule passes through and gets excreted .
Can you tell where the tumor is ?
I couldn &apos;t when I was working on this .
Now it &apos;s green .
Patients are still on the operating room table .
And what I &apos;m talking about are nerves .
What &apos;s the problem ?
But I went ahead anyway .
And Roger helped me .
So here &apos;s a tumor .
Now you do .
Do you know where it &apos;s going ?
Now you do .
This was a bit of a breakthrough .
They said , &quot; Wow !
We are focused on making this technology better .
It is not a sprint .
It is not an event for the solo runner .
Thank you very much .
Because I feel an urgency about this .
You also have to do it .
And I am convinced .
And we learn amity .
Thank you very much .
Now , why do I say that ?
And here are the statistics .
The buildings here are multi-story .
They have more things going on in them .
It &apos;s on very steep ground .
Beer is all carried in on your shoulders .
Beer is a very important thing in Brazil .
So , that &apos;s a restaurant .
I say there are two things .
So , these are the civic leaders of the future .
Thank you very much .
They work extraordinarily well .
It was an absolute masterpiece .
You start with 12 and they take them away .
It was made of cast iron .
It involves limited raw materials .
We invented the whole lot of them .
I &apos;ll give you one example .
But a six is very different from a nine .
Just try both of them .
Take a square one there , first .
The first one ?
Thank you very much indeed .
And so they took them to some safe place .
And about 20 years went by .
And that was , &quot; How did this happen to me ? &quot;
It was on Jonestown .
Thank you very much .
She ended up underneath the car .
Somehow I ended up at the hospital .
I was 64 lbs .
But who &apos;s counting ?
I was bald .
I was wearing hospital scrubs .
This kid needs a lot of work . &quot;
But I did say no to the blue hair .
So I moved on from there .
So we &apos;ll just keep moving on .
So close your eyes .
If it &apos;s hit , don &apos;t cross the street . &quot;
Made perfect sense .
Not magically .
So I was walking around it .
And I go , &quot; I &apos;m just going to touch it . &quot;
Thank you so much .
Namaste . Salaam .
Shalom . Sat Sri Akal .
And Pakistan , in this particular vein , is very similar .
My name is Zamin .
Do I matter , or really exist for you ?
And that is why I want to illuminate the world .
My name is Papusay .
My heart and drum beat as one .
A rising tide lifts all boats .
We are but two threads cut from the same cloth .
That was fantastic .
I found that really moving .
It felt like it was really important .
I just really wanted to acknowledge you .
Thank you so much .
But Mr. Teszler answered , &quot; No , that will not be necessary .
And then resumed the beating .
Do you have any other questions ? &quot;
And I think that is incredible .
Thank you .
&quot; We learned it in college . &quot;
And what is the definition then ? &quot; The definition ?
And here you have the dataset .
And really this is about the bedroom .
Here we go .
But this was 1963 .
It &apos;s not really , really flat .
These people go to bed hungry .
And this is the number of people .
It changed like this .
And it goes over here ?
Probably the world will do this .
and then it will continue forward like this .
It &apos;s Lincoln here , advancing them .
This is very serious .
Look here . This is the world .
And what has happened in the world ?
That &apos;s where we were , 1900 .
Well the Swedish students protest at this point .
Not simplistic extrapolation .
The blue is Africa .
It will never affect a rich person .
It &apos;s the World Department .
I was free , I was happy .
It was a dimly lit shack .
I wanted to blend in like a chameleon .
He said that his vote was in his heart .
The heat was on .
People were being beaten brutally .
It was complete chaos .
We want peace . &quot;
The sounds of the voices were harmonious .
So it could happen .
Now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
I mean , it was so incredibly close .
And guess what , it worked .
And yes , we Africans can .
Thank you .
There &apos;s also a time to give .
That was a tradition I wanted to follow .
This was once a park .
A hospital in Zambia .
This is a scene from New Orleans .
And they went surfing .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
So let &apos;s switch back to that .
Thank you .
So thank you very much .
Take a look at this plant .
This brings me to another example .
The monkeys are not stupid animals .
But if you water it , this is what you get .
So let &apos;s take a look at this plant here , Centella asiatica . It &apos;s a weed .
We call it a weed .
It &apos;s a plant .
Thank you .
There &apos;s another reason as well .
You see , I have a passion for racing .
It &apos;s extraordinary to watch .
And then he has to turn left .
And their actions are fantastic .
Thank you .
&quot; Surely not . &quot;
It &apos;s a common reaction .
It &apos;s a quick talk .
&quot; You cannot be serious ! &quot;
She lives in England .
The U.N. agrees too .
History suggests not .
There &apos;s also been some success .
So what can be done ?
Three times !
They bought equities too .
It was the same elsewhere .
Brilliant .
So far so good .
How risky is this ?
Are you read for this ?
There was no inflation .
Thank you very much .
But it &apos;s very simple . It &apos;s very simplistic .
We consider first that life has a body .
Life also has a kind of inheritable information .
So that &apos;s just forming some body stuff , right ?
Some architectures .
So , something is missing .
Some things are missing .
You add the droplet to the system .
So I add some food source to the system .
That didn &apos;t happen before . There it goes .
Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit , while protocell B does the fusing , okay ?
Just with blobs of chemicals , again .
Think of it like a primordial ooze , okay ?
Without the Sun , there &apos;s likely to be no life on this planet .
And they &apos;re like , &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s pretty straightforward . &quot;
&quot; Great -- got it . &quot;
So the next day I go out .
Alright . Great .
Being an apprentice , you know , you do that .
I say , &quot; Time out . Stop . &quot;
I said , &quot; Stop . This is nuts . &quot;
I mean , you know .
&quot; This is crazy .
We can &apos;t do this . &quot;
He says , &quot; OK . &quot;
When does he get up ? &quot;
He &apos;s like , &quot; A day . &quot;
&quot; A week . &quot;
He &apos;s , you know , nibbling on some grass , frolicking .
Albert hands me the knife .
I go in , tail comes off .
I do .
&quot; Push it further . &quot;
I do .
Just bite &apos; em off . &quot;
I went in and I took them .
Great .
You know ?
Neo in &quot; The Matrix , &quot; you know ?
And I talk to him .
And he says , &quot; Hey Mike .
Because , dude , you know , four years . &quot;
He &apos;s making a great living .
and he &apos;d laugh at you .
He didn &apos;t follow his passion .
Follow his passion ? The guy &apos;s -- come on .
Safety -- safety first ?
Right ?
No , I mean really .
Unspeakably dangerous .
And he points out there .
My responsibility is to get you home rich . &quot;
And for the rest of that day , safety first .
Anyhow , a whole lot of things .
But , what it all comes down to is this .
It &apos;s a civil war .
It &apos;s a cold war , really .
That &apos;s what TV does .
We &apos;re plugged in ; we &apos;re connected .
I got a lot wrong .
The infrastructure is a huge deal .
They power our minds .
Run the movie , please .
They pass information to each other .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s called &quot; Kaleidoscope . &quot;
How do I compose ?
Wow , a volunteer , yay !
Nice to meet you .
GH : OK . One . Two . Three .
Oh , D and F -- too familiar .
JL : One more .
JL : Thank you very much .
OK , that &apos;s nice .
So I started shooting time-lapse photography .
Look at the sky .
We so rarely look at the sky .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Okay , lots of you .
The act of observation changes it .
It &apos;s the same in marketing .
Think about Toyota .
Well , you know the story .
The same is true of marketing .
It &apos;s out of your control .
Thank you .
This is our motivation .
We talk with our hands .
We greet with our hands .
There are two general types .
They work by harnessing shoulder power .
Now you &apos;ve lost your arm above the elbow .
What do you do ?
We have robotic limbs .
There &apos;s no other functions .
How do we control them ?
That &apos;s the idea .
His name is Jesse Sullivan .
And this is what it looks like .
His brain is thinking about his arm .
There is not a learning process .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s intuitive .
So it was very exciting .
All right .
Please welcome Amanda Kitts .
And you &apos;ve got one of these conventional arms .
Can you tell us how it worked ?
You had to concentrate a whole lot .
And how did that work for you ?
AK : It works good .
I could work them just by my thoughts .
TK : A little faster ?
It &apos;s like 96 percent .
And it provides intuitive control .
So that was all very exciting .
Can we get more out of it ?
See .
And I have the wrist flexion and extension .
And I also have the hand closed and open .
TK : Thank you , Amanda .
She &apos;s carrying all the weight through harnesses .
I can wear it around .
If it stops working for some reason , I can retrain it .
Takes about a minute .
It &apos;s all the pattern recognition .
AK : I was able to get four .
AK : Can &apos;t clap with this one .
I want you to watch closely .
Claudia : Oooooh !
I &apos;ve got a real estate problem .
The future is bright .
And we really appreciate you all being here today .
That &apos;s science .
And fortunately , it worked today .
So thank you very much .
What I discovered was this is not true .
This is what I found out .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Why is that ?
These people aren &apos;t that smart .
Hers is more into boys .
Girl 2 : Uh , yeah .
Girl 3 : This is my pretend &#91; unclear &#93; one .
Let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
Rockett : Hi Miko ! What &apos;s going on ?
She asked me to make sure you knew about it .
Miko : I don &apos;t think so .
Oops , I turned the wrong way .
We love them .
We see them .
&quot; Rockett 28 ! &quot;
Thanks .
Good morning everybody .
The first thing is water .
But what if it wasn &apos;t ?
So nothing is getting through .
Would you like to see that ?
Have a smell of that , mister cameraman .
Okay . Right .
Audience : Ugh !
So I &apos;m just going to put that in there .
Put that in there . There we go .
Okay . Now .
You just scoop the water up .
Okay . There we go .
Replace the top .
Give it a few pumps . Okay ?
That &apos;s all that &apos;s necessary .
I &apos;ve got to be quick . Okay , ready ?
There we go . Mind the electrics .
Cheers .
There you go Chris .
What &apos;s it taste of ?
Michael Pritchard : Okay .
We ship water .
And how much does it cost ?
About half a cent a day to run .
Thank you .
But why stop there ?
Thank you .
Ah-hah .
So , the god Vishnu arrived .
&quot; Are there any witnesses ? &quot;
Vishnu gave his judgment .
There is a trend here .
Good morning .
Well , somebody had a great idea .
All right , father .
So this is the cotton sari .
You are peaceful people .
How could it be otherwise ?
But , what if ...
Yes . What if ...
You &apos;re V-I-O-L-E-N-T .
Goodbye , Abraham Lincoln .
Goodbye , Mahatma Gandhi .
Goodbye , Martin Luther King .
Look what we &apos;ve ...
look what they &apos;ve done .
It needs to be the yeast . &quot;
But the princess continued whistling .
But the king had an idea .
He announced a Swayamvara .
Some whistled badly .
Some whistled well .
But nobody could defeat the princess .
&quot; Uh-huh ... &quot; she said .
Thank you .
Going back to 1976 .
And I felt very troubled .
I &apos;d like you to come and design it . &quot;
And I said , &quot; This just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
Within the working drawings !
They said , &quot; Let &apos;s rebuild the museum . &quot;
And that was a lot of heat to deal with .
And this is where it is ; it &apos;s sort of evolving .
And so it goes .
I &apos;d like to conclude by saying something ...
He who seeks order shall find gratification .
Thank you very much .
You know what they say ?
You &apos;ve read about it already .
That makes a good cartoon .
That &apos;s true .
Don &apos;t go asking for a Frappuccino there .
Well , you &apos;ve got mail .
Yeah .
You will not like it .
They wanted to stir up controversy .
You know the story .
And here we are now .
This got me thinking .
So you see the style is different .
They can disappear and escape bullets .
&quot; Another time . &quot;
In Lebanon , it was not a book .
And it worked .
He has to keep his job .
Thank you .
And let me start with this .
We didn &apos;t see a single shark .
This is what we call the biomass pyramid .
Well , there are several ways .
And this is what I saw , lots of fish .
This is very substantial .
Outside the reserve , you cannot even detect this .
So the fishermen are catching more .
Reserves are like savings accounts .
So how can we do that ?
Well , there are two ways of getting there .
Enric Sala : Thank you .
That &apos;s basically it .
That &apos;s very fascinating .
It would be just too depressing .
ES : Thank you very much .
The children looked and were amazed .
So , thank you .
Well , it just can &apos;t . That &apos;s it .
You &apos;ve got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance .
Well , is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare ?
Thank you .
They hardly ever make mistakes .
So this is a NAND gate .
We &apos;ll have spatial computing .
Thank you .
Heart disease seems far more serious .
Well , there are probably three reasons .
This is obviously not one of them .
I work for the federal government .
You &apos;ll hear more about this in a few minutes .
Are we going to be there soon ?
Thanks very much .
Now this is a huge achievement .
What does this mean ?
People don &apos;t have voice .
We were going nowhere .
The economies were not growing .
And I want to tell you something .
The issue is not that .
Is it being directed effectively ?
We were on the Biafran side .
Well , I was in the middle of it .
We thought she was going to die .
He was in the army .
So I was the oldest person in the house .
My sister fell very ill with malaria .
It didn &apos;t look like it was going to work .
And then my sister woke up .
I strapped her on my back .
You just want the person to be alive !
What has happened in Europe ?
Infrastructure everywhere .
Now , who are they accountable to ?
But it cannot do it alone .
You are undisciplined . &quot;
One idea .
Am I out of time ?
She wants to expand .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
But it is not so .
Some of them are artificial .
Well , it &apos;s very interesting .
Very , very little .
I said , &quot; Well , just short of 1.5 . &quot;
It was 1.48 .
Now , it didn &apos;t take me any time .
Very few things are very smooth .
Well , you measure and measure and measure .
We see mountains in the distance .
Now it &apos;s very easy to do .
Now a lung is something very strange .
Enormous disagreements .
Now , what good is it to have that ?
You have formulas that long .
And you crank it several times .
Well , 99.9 .
Well , they do mix .
Well actually , I was not silly .
The things on the ground are algae .
I see ; it &apos;s an island . &quot;
And amazing .
I measured it , 1.33 .
Again , again , again .
Mathematical problem : how to prove it ?
&quot; Well , acts of God .
Well , here are the curves for it .
Very simple .
This shape is of an extraordinary complication .
It &apos;s so uninteresting .
I mean this comes out .
I don &apos;t want to explain these things .
And then this one .
It &apos;s so complicated .
So where did this come from ?
Well , let me finish .
Thank you very much .
Most people do pick the paper .
It &apos;s brown to start with .
And I work in design .
And we &apos;ve busted a bunch of myths .
Allow me to explain .
I &apos;m a product designer by trade .
The drawer that you put your lettuces in ?
Yeah ? Soggy lettuces ?
It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report .
So they &apos;re very popular .
But this is the thing .
He &apos;s also watching television .
the moment that very popular TV shows end .
These kinds of products are everywhere .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Ooh .
This is Stephen Hawking &apos;s universe .
This time , I &apos;m not going to talk at all .
Thank you .
Well , it &apos;s great to be here .
Supercomputers -- same thing .
It &apos;s now under a 10th of a cent .
It turns out that we can understand it .
This will be a routine feature in a cell phone .
Thank you very much .
This is a part of that .
She &apos;s a bit of a hippie .
My father &apos;s a little different .
And I said , &quot; Hold that thought . &quot;
I said , &quot; Can I quit school then ? &quot;
And mad and crazy and fun .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m here to meet the Prime Minister . &quot;
He said , &quot; Oh , so am I. &quot;
Thank you .
This is one I remember fondly .
I said , &quot; Oh , my God . What is that ? &quot;
In the morning , I am born again . &quot;
So , I tried going to the art store .
You know , there are a hundred types of brushes .
And even bigger .
It was so exciting .
I started doing fashion .
They said , &quot; Stop saying sorry . Say , my bad . &quot;
American education is so expensive .
This is another painting .
I &apos;m joking .
That &apos;s us in New York .
Something happened along the line .
I loved the attention .
I said , &quot; Let &apos;s get married . &quot;
My mother fell very ill .
And I was devastated .
I was on a high .
My life was not exuberant .
I lost all my audiences .
Of course , none of them liked it .
I was very upset .
It &apos;s a secret .
I need to be reborn again .
That &apos;s my little son .
These are just different cartoons .
So I said , okay .
I was 17 .
And I drew it out for her .
And then I left .
Thank you so much .
Earlier this year , in March , Clay took his own life .
They send him to Iraq .
He gets out of the military . He takes his uniform off .
He doesn &apos;t have that community anymore .
They send him to Iraq .
Thank you very much .
Life was good .
Where was I ? What was happening ?
My body was consumed by pain .
I broke five ribs on my left side .
I broke my right arm . I broke my collarbone .
&quot; No . It &apos;s too hard . &quot;
I was at a crossroads .
It was the fight of my life .
You &apos;ll have internal injuries for the rest of your life .
You &apos;ll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life .
You &apos;re in a wheelchair . That &apos;s normal .
I did get depressed .
And I wanted to give up .
Gone . &quot;
I said , &quot; Mom , I &apos;m going to learn how to fly . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s nice , dear . &quot;
I said , &quot; Pass me the yellow pages . &quot;
Is that a problem ? &quot;
&quot; You get her . &quot; &quot; No , no , you take her . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I can &apos;t use my legs . &quot;
He went , &quot; Oh . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And sometimes I thought that too .
And then I got my instructor rating .
Why not learn to fly upside down ? &quot;
And Mom and Dad ? Never been up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And that &apos;s a quite clever guy , huh ?
Almost no overlap . Almost no overlap . And what has happened ?
Almost like a ghost , isn &apos;t it , huh ?
It &apos;s also moving vertically .
And watch that beginning to happen .
But that &apos;s a subject of a different discussion .
You see India , you see Brazil .
But that &apos;s no longer true .
Now we have to create the G20 .
Oh yes ? Why not ?
3,700 .
How many Americans ? 11 .
The Chinese naval contingent .
They want to keep the sea lanes open .
We are now interdependent .
Now the enemy is inside the walls .
But now one final thing .
Collective security is not enough .
They shared a destiny with their enemies .
The great poem of John Donne &apos;s .
&quot; Send not for whom the bell tolls . &quot;
The poem is called &quot; No Man is an Island . &quot;
Thank you very much .
I was coming back to visit her .
&quot; He models genes . &quot;
So suppose we toss a coin repeatedly .
It &apos;s not . A is true here .
It takes longer , on average .
How could that be ?
That turns out to be important .
I &apos;ll give you one of them .
And if it comes down a head , that &apos;s great .
On this side , there &apos;s a different experience .
Then you toss the coin .
Well , there are lots of reasons .
That &apos;s one big project .
Who likes that answer ?
That &apos;s what you might think .
Here &apos;s a little caricature of a million individuals .
What happens ?
It &apos;ll only get it wrong one percent of the time .
Here &apos;s the key intuition .
And secondly , it &apos;s palpably false .
That &apos;s the first problem .
The other explanation is that she was guilty .
We know the children died .
And they &apos;re both implausible .
That &apos;s what engineers do . &quot;
Thanks very much .
And here &apos;s the second punch line .
Thank you .
David Agus : A new strategy in the war on cancer
Because this is wrong .
So , what is cancer , first of all ?
Why is it hard to treat ?
And that &apos;s about it .
It &apos;s basically symptoms .
It &apos;s manifestations of a disease .
That hasn &apos;t changed in over 150 years .
We need to take a step back . &quot;
You know , I &apos;ve been using it for two and a half months .
Most of that state is hidden .
It &apos;s never been shown .
Another 30 percent will respond .
They &apos;re dynamic .
That &apos;s about it .
And the answer , obviously , is not .
How do I know ?
So , it &apos;s a fundamental problem .
It &apos;s taking a big picture .
Thank you very much .
And well , they &apos;re very excited .
Okay . Okay . Oh , well .
Oh , wonderful .
Good evening everybody .
Hi sweetheart . Okay .
But anyway .
But I don &apos;t mind .
Really , it &apos;s amazing .
Isn &apos;t that adorable ?
Did you know that about her ?
Yeah , she &apos;s lovely .
It &apos;s like a rainbow .
It &apos;s true . It &apos;s true .
Anyway .
Thank you for all that you do .
Congratulations . Mazel tov .
Hi . Hi .
Thank you everybody .
I like that .
That &apos;s very good . I love that .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s a long story , believe me .
And it was Madame Bousson , you know , she was very &#91; French &#93; .
But &#91; German &#93; .
Although , you know , it was wonderful .
For example , a friend of mine .
Well , I just wanted to quickly say good evening .
So , you can just imagine -- right .
Uh , well , thank you .
Good evening .
But that &apos;s where we had some problems .
So I said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong in this picture ? &quot;
I am lesbian . &quot;
Thank you . Xie xie .
I am originally from Jordan .
It is not Harvard .
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water .
I want to hold your hand .
I want to hold your hand .
Well , so okay , but please , please , but please .
Okay ? Great .
Thank you very , very much . I love you .
Well , you have to let me say this .
I just -- thank you .
So I wrote a letter .
It was a 7.6 magnitude . It was fairly big .
We had to deal with images from films like &quot; The Day After Tomorrow . &quot;
And you have to do that investigative work .
Getting real windy in just a second .
Oh , shit !
This is from Hama .
It had black-and-white curbs .
Thanks very much .
Embracing otherness .
It &apos;s no longer valid or real .
Is it who we really are ?
And it is important .
But my skin color wasn &apos;t right .
My hair wasn &apos;t right .
My history wasn &apos;t right .
I &apos;d literally lose myself .
On the one hand , result .
Right ?
And of course I did .
It happens when I dance , when I &apos;m acting .
I give it its due .
I take it to therapy .
Thank you for listening .
Thank you .
Somewhat like the curving of the universe .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m a storyteller .
I had never been outside Nigeria .
But that is another story .
My father was a professor .
I was startled .
I was 19 .
My characters drove cars .
Stories matter .
Many stories matter .
Thank you .
How are we going to introduce her ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I think she &apos;s dancing . &quot;
What are you talking about ? &quot;
And how many of you did not get that ?
I don &apos;t even know if it &apos;s truthful .
So what do you do ?
What am I doing ? I &apos;m trying to buy time .
I &apos;m trying to buy time .
Get rid of your mind .
Get out of it , get it out .
So that &apos;s what I do .
My father was a doctor .
And he said , &quot; Son , it goes on forever . &quot;
It doesn &apos;t come into my frame of reference . &quot;
So , how far does eternity go ?
What does forever mean ?
So what did I do ?
What was my story ?
So what is a story ?
We tell ourselves stories .
Now , a film .
A film tells a story .
It &apos;s called subtext .
Find that which is not .
And so they helped the just one .
The gods sent the storm . &quot;
So what was I doing ?
Psychological .
Elizabeth : Bess ?
Bess ?
Are you with child ?
Bess : Yes , my lady .
Elizabeth : Traitorous .
You dare to keep secrets from me ?
Is it his ?
Bess : Yes .
Raleigh : Majesty .
Go .
Bess : As you wish , Majesty .
Elizabeth : Get out ! Get out ! Get out !
Get out .
The architecture is telling a story .
It &apos;ll survive her .
The camera &apos;s looking down at her because she &apos;s in the well .
And an idea started to develop .
You understand flyovers ? Yeah ?
So the design has a story .
Remember the word I said , suck up .
So , okay my time is up .
Everything &apos;s a contradiction .
The universe is a contradiction .
Harmony is not resolution .
It is finite ; harmony is infinite .
Thank you very much .
It is the hot topic .
It is the place where we &apos;re learning the most .
This is the great frontier .
I &apos;m like , &quot; Looked at that . Been there .
Not going to be easy . &quot;
So let me move to cancer .
It &apos;s you ; you &apos;re broken .
I think this is the big mistake .
So thank you very much .
I make them all the time .
And that was fine with Boyle .
It wasn &apos;t like a TED conference .
And God was out of the picture .
Audience : Here .
And he had potassium nitrate .
And so I -- I did some experiments .
So you have to be honest .
And I &apos;m basically honest .
Now , let &apos;s see ...
I &apos;ve got another five minutes , right ?
You want to be rich , you be a businessman .
They had to be very cautious .
Let &apos;s take a look at San Francisco .
And so it leads to things like this .
How cool is that ?
So what is a city ?
Thank you .
He was five at the time .
I was shocked .
&#91; But now &#93; he was ready to tell .
It all hit me .
He broke the good / bad news in my face .
I looked it up , and he was right .
What happened next , of course ?
The Saudi authorities remained very quiet .
That really creeped us out .
But what I was sure of was my innocence .
I was released after nine days .
June 17 comes .
Allow me to help you answer this question .
I know .
Thank you .
Thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you .
Thank you .
I learned to be always there .
Thank you , everyone .
Thank you .
Thank you .
There &apos;s something that we &apos;re not seeing there .
But in the meantime , these things are scaling up .
These things are continuing to happen .
And this gives you an idea .
And these are some of the images from that .
You &apos;re seeing the tuxedos , the bouquets .
And they have dorms for the workers .
And this isn &apos;t even the domestic car market ; this is the taxi market .
Everything is very efficient .
So we &apos;re looking at this as trying to build out .
Walls don &apos;t work .
It &apos;s in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
That &apos;s to prevent pirates from attacking it .
It &apos;s active in the Gulf of Guinea .
We see it in the Caribbean .
At the moment , they &apos;re incarcerated .
Two trillion a year .
Crew of four . Sophisticated communications sweep .
So here we are , 21st century .
What should we do ?
Let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way .
They are all holding books .
You would be correct .
Here &apos;s another example .
They are hospital ships .
Other organizations send volunteers .
&quot; Mom , I see the world . &quot;
White is the synthesis .
Why do we want to get in these nets ?
Got a little laugh from the audience .
There was an article which was run by AP , on the wire .
Thank you .
Which I do .
So ...
He &apos;s in the Scots Guards .
Thank you .
Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you .
I hope you will enjoy .
Jake : Hey guys .
Oh , you &apos;re wiggling your toes .
Imogen Heap : &quot; Wait It Out &quot;
Find me when you can . &quot;
Thank you .
I &apos;m delighted to be here .
It &apos;s tedious .
My idea is : no ! No !
They know .
This is a Klein bottle .
This guy over here of course is me .
No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
I take lunch hour .
You won &apos;t need to know trig .
And that constant is the speed of sound .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
The cop &apos;s chasing me .
Chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
Chases me into this room .
A dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
Thank you very much .
They could be quite mild .
And the answer is this thing .
This is Aedes aegypti .
That &apos;s two days ago .
Well , there &apos;s two principle ways .
It &apos;s just not practical .
This is a picture of fogging .
It has to be safe .
You just want to get this one .
It &apos;s only the female mosquito that will actually bite you .
It &apos;s just the female .
And what &apos;s the result ?
Well , the result has been very good .
And I &apos;m in favor , actually . Of course I am .
Thank you very much .
I have a doppelganger .
Isn &apos;t that putting the cart before the horse ?
But how ?
She cut the heads off of her flies .
This is one piece of good news .
Thank you .
So -- -- so apologies to Goldie .
That &apos;s pretty good .
You &apos;ve started one or two in your time .
Why did you do that ?
I mean , what are the numbers on this ?
How much -- what &apos;s the total revenue ?
And how many employees ?
RB : About 55,000 .
RB : No .
What was that one ?
RB : Dropping in for tea .
OK .
RB : It &apos;s a tough job , isn &apos;t it ?
RB : Of course .
RB : Nobody &apos;s ever called me Sir Richard .
But nowhere else anyway .
But he &apos;s an absolute genius when it comes to design .
Have you ever regretted that ?
RB : Many times .
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses .
RB : Well , I won &apos;t contradict that .
No , trust me , it &apos;s gross .
Did this really happen ?
And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease .
That &apos;s great .
That is outrageous .
You &apos;ve been accused of being ruthless .
You get excited by an idea and , kapow !
What is that ?
RB : Well , there &apos;s -- I mean there &apos;s a lot of issues .
It &apos;s got to be consistent .
How old are you ?
RB : I &apos;m 56 .
Thank you so much .
I mean , lies !
I don &apos;t mean giving up the Internet .
Wrong .
We are the new editors .
It does not .
We can change the incentive .
Drown out the negative with the positive .
I know you do it .
You too , apparently .
So click responsibly . Thank you .
I teach chemistry .
All right , all right .
Some people nodding yes .
And rule number three : Practice reflection .
All right . Sorry .
Thank you very much .
The threat is desertification .
It is simple and complex .
It is peaceful and violent .
That &apos;s a cyclical process .
Trees or cacti are good for this .
The second alternative would be to use injection piles .
That &apos;s not true at all .
Hi everybody . So my name is Mac .
That liminal space , that &apos;s art .
All right . Venn diagram .
And she was like , &quot; Why ? &quot;
That &apos;s not going to happen . &quot;
And that &apos;s what he did .
And it &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s all wood .
This is our kind of pharmacy section .
Leeches , nature &apos;s tiny doctors .
The joke isn &apos;t a joke .
And here &apos;s just one example .
This is the first book that I ever made .
And he has to take it to school with him .
A lot of hills , real estate is at a premium .
And kids do write in .
Eliot Gannon . &quot;
Nico : Hello , this is Nico .
This is the Christmas message from Nico .
Thank you very much .
This is a river .
This is a stream .
This is a river .
This is Prickly Pear Creek .
It &apos;s a broken system .
Remember Prickly Pear .
Remember Prickly Pear .
It &apos;s a broken system .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening here .
Okay ?
And most importantly , it &apos;s working .
Thank you very much .
How come this has remained the high-water mark ?
No one &apos;s come close to that ever since .
It was 24-hour daylight .
Living conditions were quite spartan .
You become utterly incapacitated .
It &apos;s like being a drunk toddler .
You become pathetic .
I &apos;ve put on 30 pounds .
There &apos;s something in that .
Thank you .
Robert Lang : The math and magic of origami
What is origami ?
And that is what origami used to be .
But it &apos;s become something else .
Naturalism . Detail .
And you can &apos;t just draw them arbitrarily .
Nothing else .
And yeah , you really can .
Now the first step , pretty easy .
And it &apos;s so simple .
Or you could do a moose .
Or , really , any other kind of deer .
She &apos;s eating him .
I call it &quot; Snack Time . &quot;
This tree frog has toes .
So these are a couple of instrumentalists .
Do a little more complicated instrument . &quot;
Well , then you could do an organ .
And I want to show you some of these examples .
They called it the Eyeglass .
Well , about the only way is to fold it up somehow .
So you have to do something like this .
This was a small model .
Thanks .
They have it for people with allergies to peanuts .
Thank you very much .
Good morning .
However , the vehicles you see here are big .
So it has four rotors .
It &apos;s actually half the diameter .
It &apos;s inversely proportional to R.
So this should be clear in these videos .
And it does that avoiding obstacles .
And the obstacles can be moving .
So this is actually a piece of fig .
So this is what we call anonymity .
They &apos;re maintaining formation .
The formations can change .
It builds the map .
Let &apos;s watch .
The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you .
They don &apos;t understand us .
We &apos;ll see .
We need character .
So what do they do ?
It &apos;s the case of Michael .
Michael &apos;s a young guy .
Then he lost his job .
He robbed him at gunpoint .
It was a toy gun .
He got caught . He got tried .
He got convicted .
Spend your night in jail , spend your day holding down a job .
And the family was united .
He won the appeal .
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison .
And Michael disappeared .
You need to have incentives .
People have to make a living .
So he started selling marijuana .
The bank was profitable .
They serviced the loans .
We &apos;ll see .
Thanks .
So where do we go ?
Now look at the Moon .
We go to a full-frame view of this .
Let me show you that one visually .
Superstring theory -- what is it ?
The idea is like this .
Now here is the catch .
Not yet .
This is a deep question .
Let me show you how .
How would we know it ?
Thank you very much .
They answered my phone .
It was a wonderful experience .
I do not recommend this at all .
So , that was hard .
So , not very .
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles .
I had Christian bibles .
I had Jewish bibles .
So I wanted to follow those .
How should we view the Bible ?
How was the Bible written ?
It &apos;s a remarkable thing .
Third , that thou shall have reverence .
The Sabbath can be sacred .
Thou shall not stereotype .
Oh , thank you very much .
Thank you . Bless you , bless you .
And I would say , &quot; But that &apos;s crazy . &quot;
And I failed miserably .
Because you can &apos;t .
And then it was abandoned .
At the time , there was a lot of opposition .
There &apos;s three sections .
Thanks .
I refer to organized crime .
Take Mexico , for example .
And the answer is six vessels .
Now , the recession .
And it &apos;s been terribly successful .
It &apos;s really not that difficult .
Thank you very much .
People love their automobiles .
And you say , boy , that &apos;s a lot .
But you know what ?
So let me talk about hydrogen first .
And that &apos;s quite exciting .
Now that &apos;s a lot of money .
Thank you very much .
Just -- I &apos;ve got so many questions I could ask you .
I just want to ask one .
Welcome to Thailand .
There was just no future .
And this picture was sent throughout the country .
It &apos;s been blessed . &quot;
That was their perception .
And then we went to teachers .
So we went to the teachers .
Very good , mother . Move ahead .
Again , education , class entertainment .
And that was run by them .
And what happened ?
So I said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
So they were happy with that .
So they all trained .
Why just run around ?
And then what happened ?
We all need to help .
So , that was done .
It &apos;s not a free gift .
That &apos;s the difference .
And these are our Thai tulips .
Thank you very much indeed .
Now molecules are really , really tiny .
One way around this is to draw pictures .
What would it look like ?
This was work from a number of years ago .
Thank you .
It &apos;s packaged up and bundled up .
The nuclear envelope breaks down .
So again , here we are at that equator moment .
The chromosomes line up .
So this is a single chromosome .
And it &apos;s walked away down the microtubules .
It &apos;s molecular clockwork .
Thank you .
So what is it , three-dimensionally ?
Compassion is also curious .
Compassion also looks like this .
This is Jean Vanier .
Well , he was complicated .
Gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
So was Mother Teresa .
So are we all .
Thank you .
So I started sketching .
Thank you .
I mean , how nice is that ?
This is from my second book .
And of course , that wasn &apos;t the case .
It &apos;s something everybody has .
&quot; Don &apos;t mistake legibility for communication . &quot;
I was , O.K. ; that &apos;s fine .
Now , there &apos;s kind of two issues here .
It did not let up .
This says : &quot; One clean fits all . &quot; .
This is my desktop .
We are wrapping up .
You &apos;re going to be dead a really long time .
Thank you very much .
Maybe something like this .
Are they talking to one another ?
They &apos;re charismatic .
Other creatures can enjoy them too .
How do they do that ?
Incredible .
It &apos;s her &quot; come hither &quot; sign .
So it &apos;s not all sweetness and light .
Thank you .
Freeways .
He &apos;s a very demanding person .
It &apos;s not enough , a new materials .
It &apos;s not enough , new sources of energy .
I &apos;ll speak on this later on .
Seven zero .
So teach the children .
All of a sudden , the Soviet Union , they split .
OK ?
You &apos;re going to make the music and the rhythm .
Brené Brown : The power of vulnerability
And I thought , &quot; Well , what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Okay . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Let me think about this for a second . &quot;
I tried to call deep on my courage .
And so I said , &quot; You know what ?
And this is where my story starts .
I was like , &quot; Really ? &quot; and he was like , &quot; Absolutely . &quot;
That was my mantra .
But I want to be able to make them not messy .
I want to understand them .
So where I started was with connection .
This is what it &apos;s all about .
So I thought , you know what , I &apos;m going to start with connection .
You know this .
And I kind of got a handle on it .
That &apos;s it .
They believe they &apos;re worthy .
And so here &apos;s what I found .
I personally thought it was betrayal .
And it did .
Do you have any recommendations ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; What does that mean ? &quot;
And they &apos;re like , &quot; I &apos;m just saying , you know .
I was like , &quot; Okay . &quot;
And she said , &quot; How are you ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m great . I &apos;m okay . &quot;
She said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
&quot; I just need some strategies . &quot;
Thank you .
&quot; It just is what it is . &quot;
And it took about a year .
It was a slugfest .
No .
So this is what I learned .
What makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot;
I don &apos;t want to feel these .
I don &apos;t want to feel these .
God .
And it doesn &apos;t just have to be addiction .
That &apos;s it .
There &apos;s no discourse anymore .
There &apos;s no conversation .
There &apos;s just blame .
We perfect .
That &apos;s not our job .
That &apos;s our job .
We &apos;ll fix it . &quot;
The first is for instant noodles .
You know .
Okay , next , clubbing .
All right , and smoking .
All right , next .
You guys ready ?
All right .
And I want to give you an example of that .
And then he has to go even further .
Is agriculture adapted to that ?
Here &apos;s South Africa . The same story .
To Svalbard , in fact .
That &apos;s at 78 degrees north .
It &apos;s otherworldly , beautiful .
And here &apos;s the front door of this facility .
in this place there .
Thank you .
The road was too rough .
I rested for a day at home .
The next day I went to my shop .
It &apos;s a huge amount of data .
We call it the cloud of normality .
There &apos;s no rocket science here .
Thank you very much .
Good morning .
Quite empty frames .
Don &apos;t you ever forget that .
But I &apos;m going to take some medication .
I &apos;ll explain that in just a moment .
I will take enough of these . Mm .
Indeed , the whole container .
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte .
You might agree with me on that .
I wonder if that &apos;s true .
Good bye . &quot;
And she didn &apos;t answer the damn question !
Where is the will ?
Is this a hunting game ?
It &apos;s that simple .
I don &apos;t think so .
Isn &apos;t it just a lot of fun ? &quot;
We call her &quot; The Talons . &quot;
That &apos;s her , you can tell right away .
He just doesn &apos;t care .
Now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
Duh .
Very simply won .
Duh .
Well , pretty well anyway .
I have to explain that to you .
Hmm . You &apos;ve heard of it .
Keep your seats -- it &apos;s going to be okay .
The answer may surprise you .
What is homeopathy ?
He died of an overdose .
He forgot to take his pill .
Work on it . Work on it .
It &apos;s a ridiculous thing . It is absolutely ridiculous .
They might , some place out there .
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy .
I mean that &apos;s a fabulous amount of money .
It &apos;s the bottom line , the dollar line .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re looking at .
Thank you .
Spiders are also extremely old .
There are many kinds of spider silk .
We spend long days ...
That &apos;s just the best .
Thank you .
This is Dimitri .
So let &apos;s move forward .
And you &apos;re able to interact with his world .
So , he &apos;s discovering the garden .
Very simple at the start .
The other thing to use is your body .
It never works .
Milo : I could just squish it .
Do you want Milo to squash it ?
PM : No . That &apos;s the wrong thing to do .
Now look at his response .
We pick those words out .
And we &apos;ll do that in a second .
Deep .
We &apos;re actually teaching him .
How do you skim stones ?
You stand up , and you skim the stone .
It &apos;s that simple .
Milo : Ahhh . So close .
Milo : Okay .
And we &apos;re going to help him with this now .
He &apos;s just moved house . He &apos;s got no friends .
They &apos;re always getting stressed .
We don &apos;t know anyone .
This looks nice .
You cleaned up my room .
Thanks .
His mind is based in a cloud .
Thank you very much indeed .
And hence they ended up in an orphanage .
And they are having great fun .
Thank you very much .
The Earth needs no introduction .
Typically , years old .
What &apos;s the problem ?
This one weighs three tons .
It &apos;s six meters tall , four meters wide .
One satellite , one rocket .
It cost 855 million dollars .
We &apos;ve launched them .
And not just one , but many .
It &apos;s really cool . Wait for it .
Boom ! Yeah . It &apos;s the money shot .
But that &apos;s just the beginning .
It &apos;s a line scanner for the planet .
Water as well .
Thank you .
and help them to improve crop yield .
Thank you .
What problems would you solve ?
What exploration would you do ?
Thank you very much .
Deb Roy : The birth of a word
Okay .
He was an early talker .
And the &#91; horizontal &#93; axis is time .
So welcome to my home .
So here &apos;s how we &apos;re approaching this .
He &apos;s leaving red ink behind .
And there &apos;s our nanny by the door .
Nanny : You want water ?
Nanny : All right .
We call these wordscapes .
That &apos;s where those big peaks are over to the left .
It &apos;s not one way .
They talk to other people .
And he was quiet for a moment .
And I thought , &quot; What am I thinking ?
Listen very carefully .
DR : Hey .
Come here .
Can you do it ?
Oh , boy .
Can you do it ?
Baby : Yeah .
DR : Ma , he &apos;s walking .
DR : Thank you .
Jill Sobule + Julia Sweeney : The Jill and Julia Show
Founding fathers all had slaves . Sweeney : I know .
So that &apos;s what I have to say .
&apos;I failed ! &apos; He cried .
And right at the top -- faith and patience .
So you must have patience .
Somebody else is in there ahead of them .
There was no one to relate publicly to .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to begin by reciting a poem .
But something weird happened .
I became bizarrely popular .
and &quot; Does it invoke curiosity ? &quot;
And puzzling it is .
So here &apos;s the word puzzle again .
The world is full of wonder .
There were four different versions of this .
And I &apos;m just going to read one of them to you .
Impossible ? I don &apos;t think so .
I know this makes you embarrassed .
Each one of them is completely different .
&quot; What does it say ? &quot;
and &quot; What does it do ? &quot;
It &apos;s that simple .
The process goes something like this .
Voice : Things happen in pairs .
I love to sleep .
The sky is blue without clouds .
Voice : I love chocolate .
That &apos;s not the novel part .
This is Samantha .
It &apos;s beautiful . It &apos;s exactly that .
Samantha : Aaaaaah .
RP : Thank you .
I wondered , what was he thinking ?
Imagine that .
Thank you .
Simply doing nothing .
But it was more than that .
Forty-seven percent .
That &apos;s essentially what meditation is .
It &apos;s familiarizing ourselves with the present moment .
Thank you very much .
And what are their options ?
What is the local market like ?
Notice anything about it ?
It clicks .
He &apos;d made a cosmesis .
We made it thinner .
The industry average is about 65 percent .
So thank you .
They come on a weekly basis to Durban .
They all have bank accounts .
It &apos;s a weekly turnaround of production .
And the rest says it all .
Thank you very much .
Sherwin Nuland : The extraordinary power of ordinary people
And this gives me enormous hope .
Well , it reminds me a little bit of surgery .
And you know what I found out ?
There are different paradigms .
He said , &quot; I think so . &quot;
Well , you know precisely what it is .
So , here we are .
And I &apos;ll read you what it is .
Thank you very much .
The odds are , probably not .
Thank you .
Such is the power of self-study .
And these are my parents .
The world came .
So here &apos;s what Dan said .
I &apos;m sick of it .
Thank you .
But the octopus did .
It &apos;s been a good ride .
As a matter of fact , there &apos;s one right there .
It was fantastic .
They also live deep .
And it gets quiet .
And it starts getting really nice .
There &apos;s no hot water .
And this is the tropics .
It &apos;s raining like crazy here .
Indeed , it &apos;s the only thing that ever has .
Look in your heart , actually .
And fix it .
And that I do .
Thank you very much .
That &apos;s not going to do anything terrible to him . &quot;
So they did that .
It was dreadful .
I was a little prone to depression .
Well , you know what bovine stercus is ?
That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus .
So I was one of their failures .
And they tried everything they had .
They thought he had a really extraordinary future .
I could blow the depression away .
It was , &quot; Ah , fuck it ! &quot;
I stayed there for three years .
Went right back into the university and began to write books .
Well , you know , it &apos;s been a wonderful life .
It &apos;s been , as I said , close to 30 years .
And I &apos;ve always felt guilty about that .
You can be thrown off the track .
There is recovery .
There is redemption . And there is resurrection .
There is no government to protect them .
It is very tough .
That &apos;s their house .
But there are only two rules .
That &apos;s our two rules .
We can reconcile .
We can do everything .
My sister was different .
She graduated in Russia also .
Most people fled abroad .
They do everything for them .
They have done what I desire to do for them .
That &apos;s the best part .
Wait . Wait .
H Thank you .
Thank you .
My poem is called &quot; Dirt . &quot;
her hand clawing at my head .
But oh , her soap !
It took some diplomacy .
This is called &quot; The Dress . &quot;
It &apos;s a longer poem .
It actually happened right at the time we met .
It &apos;s called &quot; The Neighbor . &quot;
It startled , then bored , then repelled me .
My sweet angels , come back . &quot;
My holding the door .
I think I &apos;ll lighten up a little .
It &apos;s called &quot; Gas . &quot;
Phwap ! Phwap ! Phwap !
This is called &quot; Thirst . &quot;
&quot; Thirst . &quot;
We regarded each other , scrutinized one another .
She wouldn &apos;t have wanted me to , I would think .
The title is &quot; This Happened . &quot;
Herself fall .
Weightfully upon me was the world .
Forever . With grace .
This happened .
This is called &quot; Old Man , &quot; appropriately enough .
But forget her breasts .
Because there were images in it he said were licentious .
No . Again , no .
Vamp . Siren . Seductress .
Thank you .
It &apos;s a great honor to be here .
So it was not easy at all .
It &apos;s like the heart of the suburb in Rio .
cities are packed with people .
And this is the most controversial one .
We call it a family clinic .
It was great . It was lots of fun .
Nothing of concern in terms of traffic .
This is live transmission .
Waste collection on time .
That is fantastic .
Thank you very much .
And similar topography .
I wonder why .
And this is art . This is metaphor .
And I said , &quot; That &apos;s a good job . That &apos;s interesting .
How does that work ? &quot;
It &apos;s not just going to disappear .
That &apos;s good .
What &apos;s your act two ?
And he said , &quot; Well , financial services . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh . &quot;
And I said , &quot; How does that work ? &quot;
You just tip your hand .
And what could go wrong ?
And we &apos;re starting to make our way .
It &apos;s out of print -- still ...
Wouldn &apos;t that be handy ?
And the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t Google .
This isn &apos;t information .
What would it look like ?
And it uses what &apos;s called a bin-packing algorithm .
And the problem with that is that people freak out .
People panic .
Like the things that people use .
So let me take it back to Wall Street .
And that &apos;s going to keep happening .
This is just theoretical .
Thank you .
There were many epidemics there .
I really had very little left .
I had been traveling to one country after another .
I was emotionally feeling very isolated .
I wanted to come home .
In fact -- seriously .
And now I do that .
And one was punishment .
Diarrheal diseases had been stuck .
Malaria had been stuck .
What do the graphs look like ?
What does the data look like ?
There was clustering .
Make sense ?
In other words , what do you mean , health problem ?
What do you mean , epidemic ?
Thank you .
I love my food .
And I love information .
Oh , some of you have seen it .
And this is happening here .
The same is again true with information .
But consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable .
Do you cook it ? Do you have it served to you ?
Do you go to a restaurant ?
The same is true every time as I started thinking about information .
Thank you very much for your time .
And when Noah had done built his Ark ...
Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...
And old lady ran to the door and say , &quot; Who is it ? &quot;
And the old lady said , &quot; Oh yes , come on in . &quot;
You could be in New York .
His name was Ben .
I said , &quot; Well , Ben , what do you do ? &quot;
&quot; I make ice cream . &quot;
He said , &quot; Okay . &quot;
It was a great success .
That gets your adrenaline going .
A great success .
It failed .
Why did it fail ?
We needed to be working on beef .
We needed to be working on lumber .
So let &apos;s go back to Sudan .
Okay . Fast forward .
There &apos;s no more of it .
Now we &apos;re at 1.3 .
It &apos;s always population growth .
Let &apos;s go back and visit our equation .
We can get productivity up .
We can get efficiency up .
But we &apos;ve also got to get consumption down .
And then we need to consume less .
Okay , so let &apos;s be generous .
How do you get informed ?
You don &apos;t .
Here &apos;s a little question .
They &apos;re not .
And we need collusion .
We need Cargill to work with Bunge .
We need Coke to work with Pepsi .
We need Oxford to work with Cambridge .
Again , a daunting task .
There must be a better way .
This is nine of them .
We can &apos;t wait that long .
We don &apos;t have that kind of time .
Eight entities came to the table .
It can happen .
It &apos;s risk and demand .
It &apos;s a pre-competitive issue .
Buy it .
Thank you .
And I go on the podium .
You know , this little office of the conductor .
Let &apos;s look at the first video .
Was that nice ?
So that was a sort of a success .
Now , who should we thank for the success ?
They don &apos;t often even look at the conductor .
So that &apos;s a sort of a tradition .
Um , he was happy .
People get annoyed .
You have the story of the audience as a community . Yeah .
Riccardo Muti , please .
He &apos;s awesome . He &apos;s so commanding . Yeah ?
So clear . Maybe a little bit over-clear .
Okay ? Ready ?
But ... There is a vacancy for a ...
He says , &quot; I &apos;m responsible . &quot;
Responsible in front of him .
Do not interfere .
Did you see the hands ?
This is a German orchestra , yes ?
Now that &apos;s great . What about the eyes ?
Why are the eyes closed ?
The guy has no idea what to do .
Yeah .
He says , &quot; This is the gesture of the music .
That is another story .
It &apos;s like being on a rollercoaster . Yeah ?
That &apos;s what he does .
You have the plan in your head .
It is very tiring . Yeah ?
You also have to be very professional .
And look again at this Kleiber .
Go along with the video . Look .
&quot; Wait for me after the concert .
I have a short notice to give you . &quot;
The whole orchestra is playing .
Now something else .
Look at the eyes .
Okay . You see that ?
So that &apos;s a good thing .
And you look at Lenny and he &apos;s suffering .
This is a shopping mall .
I don &apos;t conceive of it that way .
And then there &apos;s mobile phones .
We only sell you airtime .
The name is a misnomer .
Now , there &apos;s another problem .
Thank you very much .
Nothing new was learned .
But I &apos;ll have to backtrack a little first .
&quot; Take no one &apos;s word for it . &quot;
But that can &apos;t be what made the difference .
Knowledge comes from the senses .
What &apos;s wrong with us ?
We don &apos;t see the origin of species .
But we know about those things .
How ?
But it doesn &apos;t .
Some rocks and some finches .
No one has ever seen evolution .
We see rocks .
Brains only detect nerve impulses .
It &apos;s equally testable .
Better put that up .
The year is 1963 .
We &apos;re at the ocean .
It &apos;s twilight .
That would be a mistake .
They begin to chant .
You will go far away .
We will not be there .
And it will take all of you .
It will take all of you . &quot;
These words , I hold onto all my life .
The year is 2007 .
It &apos;s the home of my mentor .
It &apos;s humanity &apos;s DNA .
We cannot afford to lose it .
The year is 2010 .
It always was .
It &apos;s the most important map of all .
That &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
Whooo !
There &apos;s a pattern here .
We have eco-friendly shrimp .
It doesn &apos;t work .
But it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
I made more money .
This is great .
Put it on four plates .
I expect a lot from food .
I get the meat sweats .
It &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
It &apos;s disgusting .
Eat your vegetables .
It &apos;s pretty straightforward .
We need to savor vegetables .
And we need to save dinner .
Thank you .
It looks like this .
Silly at a level that I hadn &apos;t yet understood silliness to be .
And then there &apos;s the elephants .
It was a Dumbo nightmare .
Where I couldn &apos;t stop looking .
It took me a little time .
And that seems fine .
And there he was .
He seems also to have forgotten his sword .
And energetic , I hope , too .
Thank you very much .
Mockingbirds are badass .
They are .
I don &apos;t care how you make &apos; em .
Where in the world is this world heading ?
That &apos;s a guess .
It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn .
Everybody gets heard .
And I &apos;m on this .
Thank you , TED .
Wow .
Hello ! My name is Golan Levin .
Anyone want to hazard a guess ?
And it &apos;s almost impossible to perform .
Okay . So ...
So let &apos;s run this and see if it works .
Hello ? And I can ... hello ... okay .
Alright . Let &apos;s leave that .
Thank you .
It &apos;s called Opto-Isolator .
It helps to have good friends .
Checking him out ...
Those are its targets .
So I was filming .
But they are .
They did so illegally .
Otherwise , I &apos;m going home . &quot;
I mean , what about their health ?
It &apos;s incredibly difficult to parse .
Home is a transient concept .
&quot; If you leave , you die . &quot;
They are dying of sadness . &quot;
How could this be ?
Thank you .
I had no practical skills .
Then pretty soon , I was broke too .
So I did just that .
And I tested them .
Thank you .
This is the sound of a dirty sock .
Which is like yellow , this one .
It &apos;s like going to a nightclub .
It &apos;s just fabulous .
Here &apos;s some faces .
And this is a completely different song .
It is very pink and very yellow .
What we still do perhaps too often .
We talk about ourselves .
And indeed they were .
They met together . They prepared .
They were startling , compelling and credible .
You can &apos;t buy that .
It &apos;s especially important now .
Why is it important now ?
That guy could teach it .
They &apos;re frequent travelers .
So here &apos;s what I &apos;m calling for you to do .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
The first one is happening right here in Chicago .
Not quite an obvious alliance .
Yeah .
So I &apos;m so proud of that .
And there are plenty of other examples like that .
And I call it &quot; hometown security . &quot;
The sum of the local is the global .
And his was gambling , compulsively .
So you need to help him out .
Over here .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference .
Those magnets are in there .
So , you might be asking , &quot; Why ?
Absolutely everything .
It &apos;s almost like ...
Just up the road .
This is it .
But there &apos;s a problem .
Can anyone see what it is ?
Right , H.
H stands for Higgs particle .
What does it do ?
So that &apos;s one thing .
Well , they do change in strength .
But they just miss .
The universe continued to expand and cool .
Absolutely remarkable .
So that &apos;s the LHC .
Thanks .
Important ? Not so very .
But this wasn &apos;t always the way .
It &apos;s called the Great Western Railway .
There we go .
And that connection is change .
What &apos;s the design brief ?
Thank you very much .
This is a 3D printer .
Many barriers are breaking down .
So how does it work ?
It sounds great .
It is great .
This is almost three meters high .
And you can actually walk into it .
Now this is an engine component .
There &apos;s a lower chance of rejection .
You &apos;re having machines fabricate themselves .
You can just make it physically on the spot .
It &apos;s all over the Web .
This is a lamp .
And you can start iterating the design .
But I don &apos;t think that that &apos;s immediate .
I don &apos;t think that will happen soon .
Here &apos;s the product being built .
It &apos;s very intricate .
Thank you .
Ben Roche : So I &apos;m Ben , by the way .
HC : Delicious .
BR : That &apos;s not it , though .
So this is a plate of nachos .
And why is it delicious ?
But where is this going ?
So here &apos;s the next challenge .
BR : Thanks , guys .
So the flaws are the key .
I &apos;m not the first person to say this .
Congrats , guys .
You can &apos;t be smart and pretty .
But , yeah .
Ha ha .
If you use that , you can get away with anything .
Like , that &apos;s all you have to do .
Thank you .
It &apos;s true .
So that &apos;s it for now .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
The numbers are pretty crazy .
Well , they &apos;re both about food .
And agriculture is where food comes from .
It &apos;s crazy .
I &apos;m talking about dying .
I &apos;m not a geriatrician .
This was their dream .
It &apos;s true .
This is not a plan either ; this is illegal .
You will need advocates .
Tape a set to your refrigerator .
You &apos;re going to need caregivers .
Finally , last words .
Thank you .
Here it is : &quot; This Island Earth . &quot;
It was , &quot; It burns ! It burns ! &quot;
But what about accidental death ?
But is this true ?
But is this true ?
And the fossils are extraordinary .
But there &apos;s lots of stuff .
There was big stuff back then .
... and then a catastrophe happened .
And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs .
Well , what &apos;s the source of this ?
Well now , I die .
Six hours later , up goes the temperature .
Its temperature drops .
What are you going to do ?
We have to beat this .
I want to be able to go back to this reef . Thank you .
This is what Roth has found out .
How do you feel about accidents ?
So we thought , you know what ?
Sounds cool , right ?
John Maeda : Designing for simplicity
They &apos;ll play it over , and over , and over .
So it was traumatizing , actually .
It &apos;s very hard work to make tofu .
Thank you .
And there was this person , Muriel Cooper .
Who knows Muriel Cooper ? Muriel Cooper ?
Lots of complex stuff .
I feel kind of bad about that .
My hair &apos;s clean -- it &apos;s okay .
End of story .
It doesn &apos;t make any sense .
It &apos;s a bit eerie , isn &apos;t it ?
Basically , it always depends .
Ghosts , right ?
Here she is .
And here &apos;s her poem .
One was his daughter , Laurence .
He converted from his Anglican faith .
Thank you .
Just bring it down a little .
It &apos;s my turn .
I still have two minutes .
I have so much admiration for him .
Decrescendo .
Gradually , bringing it down , bringing it down .
Thank you so much .
I &apos;ve been doing this for 30 years .
Why do I believe this ?
Because it &apos;s true .
It is absolutely true .
Our eyes were wide open .
And you know what else we did ?
Right ?
I was probably 30 and naive .
He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act .
Thank you .
Take a look at one of our spots .
Where &apos;s dinner ?
Please don &apos;t — Let go of me !
Help me !
The media became fixated .
And let me just put this in context .
I &apos;ll tell you : 158 .
I apologize to the men in the audience .
I know you do .
They do talk to their kids .
They talk to their kids as parents , as coaches . &quot;
And that &apos;s what we did .
She sat right down next to him .
Really . I clap for you .
You can &apos;t make that one up .
Thank you very much .
They really needed the money .
It &apos;s pretty extraordinary .
Imagine that was Lake Huron .
It &apos;s an extraordinary change .
Let &apos;s start with this .
The Soviet Union didn &apos;t really have a Sierra Club .
Let &apos;s put it that way .
Weather patterns have changed .
This is an environmental disaster writ large .
That &apos;s more than all our transportation .
It &apos;s more than all our electricity .
And they &apos;re both happening at the same time .
Plants need water and nutrients .
And we all need food .
But how ?
But it &apos;s not the only problem .
That &apos;s the size of Africa .
Some dry up altogether .
The consequence ?
Here &apos;s the dilemma ...
So where do we go from here ?
must work together .
So thanks very much .
There are three important reasons .
It runs out of space .
He &apos;s at home having tea .
It is what you infer about that room .
Is it capable of doing it ?
It &apos;s a new brain . You needed it .
And it has not stopped its evolutionary path .
But it &apos;s not just a symphony of perception .
But it &apos;s not only education .
It &apos;s also genetics .
How many trees does it have ?
What shapes are the trees ?
Every neuron is different .
Well , we don &apos;t have to speculate .
Take the magic carpet for a ride .
It &apos;s the first view .
Where is it inside the neocortex ?
Because that is what it &apos;s creating .
It &apos;s creating electrical patterns .
It was 23 metric tons for one liter .
And this is a person who is alive .
At any rate , what is consciousness ?
What is a conscious mind ?
We have selves .
We own our minds .
But what about the self ?
It &apos;s the following .
And so that is a beginning .
So what is the picture that we get here ?
That &apos;s where the difference is .
But the novelty is here .
Second , understanding society and culture .
And finally , medicine .
Thank you for your attention .
3 : 19 .
5 : 10 .
5 : 58 .
6 : 20 .
And he invented the shipping container .
This stuff is really important . This stuff is really vital . &quot;
You can draw from this .
It &apos;s there for our use , on some level .
So , what came out of this ?
And I think that &apos;s what this is very much about .
It &apos;s about this really .
And that was completely irrelevant .
I hope you &apos;ll all wear them .
Good morning .
But no , I wasn &apos;t born there .
It went like this .
Communism !
The story was a bestseller .
Paradise on Earth , again .
Those who do not are doomed to fail .
Fool me once ...
The rest is history .
Six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty .
Well , the assumptions are wrong .
The opposites are true .
It won &apos;t last long because it cannot adapt .
Now here are the facts .
It &apos;s serious business .
They conduct public opinion surveys .
Then they promote the winners .
There , they enter high officialdom .
Now , please don &apos;t get me wrong , okay ?
This is not a put-down .
Where is the source of legitimacy ? &quot;
We all know the facts .
Pollution is one . Food safety . Population issues .
So here they are .
Now , I want to clarify something .
I &apos;m not here to make an indictment of democracy .
And worst of all , it is boring .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thanks .
The Chinese government .
Many seem to agree .
Your house has caught fire .
Spectroscopy , that was another one .
Parallel universes .
That one &apos;s gone as well .
Emmanuel ? Absolutely .
Don &apos;t go through this . Don &apos;t do it . &quot;
Fantastic . Really good .
And there he is .
I &apos;m so sorry .
I &apos;m so sorry . No , no .
No , no , ahh ...
Uh , no . &quot;
No . &quot;
: &quot; Yeah , alright , come on , eh .
Alright Gordon , come on , eh .
Am I right ?
&quot; And now it &apos;s got a hangover . &quot;
Wonderful news .
How many people here are left-handed ?
&quot; Well , you know I &apos;m sorry about that .
&quot; You know , it &apos;s the end of an error &#91; sic &#93; .
There is now . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re going to find you . &quot;
Sorry , what ? &quot; A nu-ca-ler . &quot;
Could you say &quot; avuncular &quot; ? &quot; Avunclear . &quot;
Thank you very much .
&quot; Travels the world . &quot;
&quot; ... who said , reach out and touch ... &quot;
&quot; ... somebody &apos;s gla -- hand . &quot;
And I , you know . &quot;
Mandela , the great man Mandela .
Why would I need a bloody water feature ? &quot;
Thank you very much indeed .
I &apos;m the one with the blond hair .
Now I &apos;m not a scientist .
You know , I don &apos;t know how to build a drug .
No . No , right ?
It &apos;s almost self-funding .
And all that actually took a lot of time .
That &apos;s a hundred thousand billion .
There &apos;s plenty of money .
The conference was held over the summer , this past summer .
So I &apos;d like to think it was a good sign .
I can &apos;t build a drug .
Thank you .
And I felt overwhelmed .
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that .
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .
They might be able to buy mosquito nets .
We sent it over to Uganda .
So they &apos;re not a donation .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m working on now .
I think we all already know that .
Just a sec .
Thanks .
Thanks .
Thank you .
Just existing .
I &apos;m going , OK , you know . Fine .
Um .
Good for you .
I just don &apos;t believe that .
That &apos;s kind of a no-brainer .
And he said , &quot; No . &quot;
And he said , &quot; No .
You &apos;re not a duck .
But you may , you may .
I don &apos;t own a guesthouse .
It &apos;s just not true .
Giving your life away .
It doesn &apos;t come from sex .
It doesn &apos;t come from salary .
It comes from serving .
That , actually , was the easy part .
That &apos;s what he prays .
He says , &quot; I want you to make me famous .
I want you to give me power .
I want you to make me famous .
I want you to give me influence . &quot;
What &apos;s in your hand ?
Moses says , &quot; It &apos;s a staff .
It &apos;s a shepherd &apos;s staff . &quot;
And God says , &quot; Throw it down . &quot;
So , He &apos;s going , &quot; What &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
What &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
And it represents your influence .
That &apos;s my girl .
Thank you .
And it has no DNA .
This is a violent process .
That can &apos;t be energetically sensible .
It looks beautiful .
They think big . Okay ?
The protocells can actually move away from the light .
Thank you .
But let &apos;s start at the beginning .
This is a decrease by two-thirds .
Take the example of Northern Ireland .
By no means .
A final example : Kosovo .
First , leadership .
Second , diplomacy .
Third , institutional design .
Thank you .
You know , is it worth trying to get there ?
It &apos;s starting to be a little bit more specified .
I like the physical book .
And it turns out to not be very hard .
We &apos;re in good enough shape .
So how much is there ?
This doesn &apos;t make any sense .
But half of those were Indian .
Television comes quite a bit larger .
so we &apos;re hedging our bets here .
Thank you very much .
Nothing else .
Music is life .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s start with city hall .
This is a newspaper ad .
Now that would never happen .
Public space .
This is the cover story .
Anyone ?
It &apos;s voluntary .
Political parties : oh boy .
We can open up city hall .
Thank you .
They were still a mistrusted lot .
They died of massive infection .
But eventually they did come around .
Something so simple .
The learning curve was very long .
But this is hard .
This is all done in between the ribs .
And cost is one of them .
But there are other barriers .
And you need to put some new incisions in there .
And you need to re-set it up .
Ready ? So here it comes .
He &apos;s a cheeky little devil .
It &apos;s not so simple .
We need to see beyond the surface .
This is a cancer surgery .
So this is all very prototypey at this point .
We can heal the disease .
And that is not the case .
These maladies come for us all .
Thank you .
I think it will be quite a challenge for me .
It &apos;s called Kunene region .
This is where I &apos;m coming from .
I &apos;m a Himba .
Don &apos;t move . Stand your ground .
I was born in 1971 .
We were hungry .
It &apos;s a very sad story .
&quot; Eh ? The poachers ? &quot;
&quot; Yes . Our poachers . &quot;
And that was my father .
And here are the new ideas .
They were not people from outside .
These were our own people .
Don &apos;t walk out at night !
This is outside the protected area .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s not great for parents with kids .
It &apos;s not great for seniors . It &apos;s not great for retailers .
It was chaotic .
It &apos;s been a total home run .
All the people arrived .
It was about those lawn chairs .
&quot; Do you like the color of the lawn chairs ? &quot;
I love this because it looks so easy .
Bike volumes have spiked .
The green line is the number of bike lanes .
And this is what we had done .
People have ridden seven million miles .
Quite radical .
It was just fantastic .
They &apos;re hidden in plain sight .
Thank you .
Take marriage for example .
That &apos;s 75 percent .
Now I &apos;m a scientist , I do experiments .
That &apos;s most of us here .
How interesting are you ?
How attractive are you ?
How honest are you ?
It &apos;s quite widespread .
So some people say no .
So why is that ?
Anticipation made them happy .
So all in all , optimism has lots of benefits .
It looks like this .
And there &apos;s a way for us to do that .
Thank you .
It is a -- sort of a great human progress .
If you think about going into space , it &apos;s a fascinating thing .
It &apos;s going to be different than here .
We &apos;re very sensitive to that as humans .
And let me justify that with two statements .
Thank you . John . That &apos;s great .
So , very cool .
JH : And your question ?
She said , &quot; That one &apos;s the closest . &quot;
What would you do ?
It should have been over .
He lost his fiancée .
He was 35 years old .
Well , why ?
They &apos;re reconstructive .
You were frightened . You were crying .
Hello , Santa Claus .
We need independent corroboration .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks very much .
Hello everyone .
Are you ready to go ? OK .
Just to make it a little bit more exciting .
All right . Take it away , Rufus .
All right . There you go .
Thank you .
Thank you . Shukran .
That &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
Now , you would rather be C.
How does this help us understand ?
Now , look at this .
Thank you .
That &apos;s my question .
The first one is mass .
It &apos;s like tapered to the downside .
It &apos;s fairly simple .
The third thing operates on a different level .
How do we calm it down ?
So I have a brother , Gavin .
He loved to cook .
But then he started to realize something .
Thank you .
So , let &apos;s see .
But then I started to realize something .
And you can make that change .
Thank you .
And it is a marvelous rain forest .
And through the children is usually the way to go .
They are interested .
And it really works to start with them .
And king cobras feed only on snakes .
So , the tiger is the icon .
And the thing is , it &apos;s not just big industry .
This is the home of the gharial , this incredible crocodile .
This was actually just taken last year .
But it &apos;s possibly , and definitely not enough .
This is a relatively clean river .
The Chambal , if you look at it , has clear water .
I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside .
And it &apos;s a horribly painful death .
So , who is next ? Us ?
Because we are all dependent on these water sources .
We &apos;re still working hard at it .
And it &apos;s a bleak future for them .
So , we can do it .
And these are powerful water totems .
Namaste .
You know , most people are terrified of snakes .
It &apos;s not like the teddy bear .
This guy specializes in pit vipers .
Thanks Rom . Thank you .
The impact was great .
It was fantastic .
I am an undercover journalist .
They got themselves ready .
It was time to go undercover again .
I didn &apos;t utter a word .
But my colleagues didn &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve never stepped there before .
So I &apos;m surprised .
I have been undercover in the prisons .
Toilet facilities : very bad .
Of course , drugs were abundant .
Show me the evidence . &quot;
I say , &quot; This is the evidence . &quot;
This will not stop .
Thank you very much .
I have some questions for you .
AA Yes , yes .
How do you do that ?
If you don &apos;t , you will end up losing your life .
AA Thank you .
Thank you . Stay safe .
I love to collect things .
I &apos;d never really memorialized myself .
Thank you .
One out of every seven people .
Why should we care ?
People have to eat .
There &apos;s going to be a lot of people .
A hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t .
Well guess what ?
And this is climate-proof .
Families need the help .
We know this .
Absolutely not .
Food is gold there .
And guess what ?
We have to stand together .
Thank you .
I use information , education .
Please put your hands up .
Most of you . OK .
Right ?
Right ?
This is a global problem .
It &apos;s a catastrophe .
It &apos;s sweeping the world .
We need a revolution .
Think about smoking .
We &apos;re in a tipping-point moment .
I &apos;ve been doing this for seven years .
I went to the eye of the storm .
Or it was last year .
Beautiful town .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She has six years to live .
This is a normal family , guys .
The family &apos;s obese .
He gets bullied , for God &apos;s sake .
He &apos;s sick of it .
I need you to understand it .
Let &apos;s start with the Main Street .
Supermarkets as well .
Big companies . Big companies .
Home .
How are you feeling ?
But I &apos;m killing them .
But we can stop that .
OK , school .
OK ?
I &apos;m not slagging them off .
They &apos;re doing the best they can do .
They &apos;re doing their best .
Knives and forks ? No , they &apos;re too dangerous .
We &apos;re not teaching our kids .
Do you know what that is ?
They &apos;ll be having two bottles . OK ?
And most kids do .
But milk ain &apos;t good enough anymore .
Do you know what I mean ?
Okay ? There &apos;s sugar in everything .
So , let me just show you .
You know , there &apos;s your week .
There &apos;s your month .
That &apos;s the good news .
So , supermarkets .
Week in , week out .
This is not expensive .
I know how they do it .
OK , school .
Life skills .
Let &apos;s go back to the home .
Absolutely .
This is real , tangible change , real , tangible change .
It &apos;s incredibly important .
I &apos;m here .
So , my wish .
Thank you .
Dogs have interests .
It &apos;s a difficult choice , right ?
I mean , you lose .
And you go , &quot; Oh , there &apos;s a good boy . &quot;
Dogs get so abused .
Because he grew ?
This is insanity .
Go on , something should happen now .
Well , I &apos;ve got news for you .
You know , &quot; Sit , sit . &quot;
Will it do it ?
Not necessarily , no .
They &apos;re like Golden Retrievers .
And now the dog &apos;s really happy .
And this , to me , is always what training is .
This is a life-or-death thing .
It doesn &apos;t have to be .
The behavior problem was going away .
She never raised her voice .
&quot; Bad bear , bad bear ! &quot; Voom !
This is crazy .
So , where do we go from here ?
The dog says , &quot; I don &apos;t think so . &quot;
Kick , kick , kick .
And this is what it &apos;s all about .
You know , kind of like a little robot .
It really is .
When I was a kid , I was a calculus whiz .
Your kids are easy to train .
This should be taught in schools .
So what happens ?
I step on the brake .
I slammed on the brakes .
They travel down roads .
That &apos;s very nice about them .
And same with the other cars .
Both models improve .
Everybody wins .
Thank you .
Hopefully it won &apos;t stutter .
I was born with some form of disease .
Voice : What kind of disease ?
I &apos;m sorry .
Girl : Are you sick ?
But ... maybe not .
I felt pretty good , considering .
Now , Fincher is an interesting guy .
And David won &apos;t take &quot; no . &quot;
It happened to be this guy .
Sounded great .
But we did know one thing .
That &apos;s not terribly compelling .
We needed the subtleties of the skin .
This was when we had our &quot; Aha ! &quot;
And this really became the template for moving forward .
And so we looped the scenes .
He watched again and again .
We encouraged him to improvise .
And then , again , the final shot .
It was a long process .
He was very popular .
The skin had to be absolutely accurate .
Take another look .
But , that is Benjamin . Thank you .
Points out the window .
Points out the window .
We all love stories .
We &apos;re born for them .
Stories affirm who we are .
Come , let &apos;s go inside .
I took to this like a duck to water .
And a year after that , we did conquer it .
So let &apos;s make him selfish . And this is what you get .
Woody : What do you think you &apos;re doing ?
Off the bed .
Hey , off the bed !
Woody : No , he is .
Slinky ? Slink ... Slinky !
Get up here and do your job .
Are you deaf ?
I said , take care of them .
You don &apos;t think I was right ?
I couldn &apos;t get enough of it .
Boy : Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey !
Cyclist : Who are you ?
Who are you ?
Thumper : Come on . It &apos;s all right .
Look .
The water &apos;s stiff .
Bambi : Yippee !
Come on . Get up .
Like this .
Ha ha . No , no , no .
Marlin : There , there , there .
It &apos;s okay , daddy &apos;s here .
Daddy &apos;s got you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s the Second World War .
A German prison camp .
So the situation seemed pretty desperate .
It looks like crude oil .
It tastes ...
zesty .
And he had a name for it .
Three pieces of data is nothing .
He &apos;s at MIT .
Brilliant work .
And we don &apos;t .
We never do .
We clearly can .
Here &apos;s an example .
Maybe I should clarify it .
What is evolution ?
So let &apos;s say you wanted to make detergent .
How do you do it ?
You create a spray of detergent .
It falls to the floor .
You sell it at a supermarket .
You make lots of money .
How do you design that nozzle ?
It turns out to be very important .
That is a huge failure rate .
I sometimes wonder .
Obviously experimentation is very important .
So I say , okay , fine .
I have no idea how to do it .
I have half a dozen ideas .
It &apos;s so uncomfortable .
He ran his trial .
But we have something .
They should be in hospital . &quot;
Shut it down at once . &quot;
Archie lets it die down .
It isn &apos;t easy .
It &apos;s incredibly painful .
But it was always a conjecture .
He made a lot of mistakes .
Thank you .
He ran and worked in a factory .
My grandmother was a homemaker .
And he wandered away .
Yeah .
My book had a title page .
I had art .
Don &apos;t tempt me , because I will do it .
And I just flourished here .
My grandfather &apos;s just going to kill me . &quot;
And a video camera .
And I kept making comics .
They sold out of all of their books .
My grandparents , they were in the middle of it .
And for him , it &apos;s only his second .
Thank you .
I have a daughter , Mulan .
And I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And she goes , &quot; And what &apos;s this fertilizing ? &quot;
So I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , funny you should ask .
And you go through the woman &apos;s vagina . &quot;
And I said , &quot; I know .
I know . &quot;
Bad zoning , but ... &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And I said , &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; That is exactly right .
That &apos;s exactly how it happens . &quot;
Oh ... &quot;
Would that ever happen ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh , no , no .
That &apos;s not how we do it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand the legs . &quot;
And I go , &quot; I know , but the legs ... &quot;
She goes , &quot; What about dogs ? &quot;
That would never happen . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . I &apos;m so happy to be here .
And Brian &apos;s shoulders sank .
And they &apos;re just so uncomfortable .
And he &apos;s just a lovely guy .
And we talked about snakes . I don &apos;t know why we talked about snakes .
And he &apos;d get them comfortable with that .
And when they touched the snake everything was fine . They were cured .
In fact , everything was better than fine .
That transformation is amazing .
And this is what he came up with .
And the results were super dramatic .
It was cancer . It was the bad kind .
And so there were lots of projects that I could work on .
And they just make better decisions .
Thank you .
And the women said , &quot; It really is . &quot;
So that &apos;s about 50,000 people affected .
It shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
Thank you .
Shaffi Mather : A new way to fight corruption
Such a service simply do not exist .
The target market is as tempting as it can get .
SM : So let me ... Let me give you an example .
Somebody who had applied for the passport .
And he will push us back .
So , it actually works .
I mean , this could be huge .
And that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;m saying .
It &apos;s called the sunga &apos; .
So the businesses are getting out their checkbooks .
What they &apos;re not really doing is hiring .
It was written by an algorithm .
Let me give you a couple examples .
Thanks very much .
And we come from a long tradition of sharing .
We &apos;ve shared transportation .
Wow , that &apos;s great . Okay , thank you .
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe .
They made it aspirational .
What percentage of the time ?
Any guesses ?
Those are really very good .
I was imagining it was like 20 percent when I first started .
The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent .
So , really interesting .
Platforms are invitations .
And honestly , it &apos;s full of surprises .
And so there &apos;s about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.
That space is not vital .
And this is a very mesh-y thing .
So this is an example .
They made a lot of mistakes .
And it grows on a very regular daily basis .
But it &apos;s very much at the beginning .
And thank you very much .
But that &apos;s just the beginning .
That &apos;s where this is all starting .
That looks like this .
And this can be a problem , as I learned .
And I &apos;m trying to play possum .
OK . So , that &apos;s the first night .
And really interesting stuff .
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
And obesity we already talked about , the ways to get to that .
Thanks for your attention .
Here &apos;s the first example .
But there are some exceptions .
They both have that kind of up-sweep .
This is a bad situation .
The world is mostly blue .
Nobody sang the old ones .
You sound very nearby .
That &apos;s shown down here .
You only hear the low frequencies .
I &apos;ll describe a couple strategies .
The shipping lanes have been moved .
Thank you very much .
Tear gas ? Anyone ?
I made it .
There was no violence .
There was no action scenes .
This is a bus .
It &apos;s written there , &quot; Theft . &quot;
It was about everything .
We are using basically this .
We are using smartphones .
We are not competing for news .
It happened in many cases .
Thank you very much . It was an honor .
Here .
Here .
Here .
Perspectives can change .
Perspectives can be altered .
Is it really just us ?
So , what exactly is SETI ?
Remember , one billion ?
Alright , one billion stars .
This is a very good year .
So , what would change everything ?
Why ?
That brings me to my wish .
Thank you .
These dwellings are called the yaodongs .
Thank you .
Ray Zahab : My trek to the South Pole
You &apos;ll be in a massive headwind .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you very much .
And I said , &quot; Do you really ? &quot;
What do I mean by fluent ?
And it &apos;s similar with new technologies .
But coding doesn &apos;t have to be like this .
Here &apos;s an example .
It uses the webcam .
And it &apos;s the same thing with coding .
But that &apos;s just where it starts .
Let me show you an example .
He wanted to keep score .
So I showed him .
I &apos;ll call it score .
And it &apos;s in fact working .
Again , the same thing with coding .
Thanks very much .
Which really bothers me .
Now , what have kids done ?
Thank you .
Or just like you ? Really ?
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Okay , that &apos;s the majority .
He collected all kinds of case studies .
The next day I rejoiced with trembling .
Others use psychedelic drugs .
It feels somehow uplifting .
Now profane is the opposite of sacred .
Well let me show you .
So here &apos;s a group of guys on a college crew team .
There are guys competing with each other .
It takes advantage of the others .
Look at the people in these photos I &apos;ve been showing you .
What &apos;s missing ?
JH : Thank you .
It &apos;s quite a cute little fellow .
Is it miserable ? It doesn &apos;t seem to be .
She says , &quot; I &apos;m 60 . &quot;
Okay .
That &apos;s what that arrow means .
You know about a lot of them .
And that is the case in flies .
And there are hints of this .
It damaged the gene .
How could that work ?
And the immune system is more active .
So it &apos;s really interesting .
So what about the normal worm ?
So it can &apos;t turn the genes on .
But it &apos;s deteriorating .
Thank you .
Let me get this straight .
There isn &apos;t the technology to do that .
It &apos;s not clear .
It &apos;s more like , say , if you were a dog .
It &apos;s more like that .
Thank you very much .
It was all just gone .
Have a little turret there .
And these buttons there -- those are chicken eggs .
Then , this is a look at the inside .
This is going up into the turret .
If not , it goes into the toilet .
So don &apos;t put it there .
Then , another bathroom upstairs .
Don &apos;t put it in the foyer .
What does that mean ?
Oh , that &apos;s a cell phone .
But you &apos;ve never seen this one before .
Oh , that &apos;s a cell phone .
That &apos;s not a cell phone .
We &apos;ll go , &quot; Ooh , that &apos;s nice . &quot;
Repetition creates pattern .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference .
That &apos;s the difference .
I feature blemish .
I feature organic process .
&quot; Oops , scratch , dumpster . &quot;
Well , that &apos;s just a myth .
So we hired on .
Do the math . &quot;
The problem is we can &apos;t afford it .
Now there &apos;s a blight on the planet .
Are we just being numbingly stupid ?
The walls are this thick .
&quot; No , no . We had a wind last night .
It &apos;s gone now . &quot;
&quot; Woo . Woohooo . &quot;
How disgusting .
My oh my , that makes it worse .
It &apos;s a pretty quick read .
That happens in the building industry as well .
The last thing is gregariousness .
Human beings are a social species .
Human beings are like that .
And so you see this in junior high a lot .
Right there is reason enough to have uniforms .
And so that happens in the building industry as well .
But that &apos;s okay .
What a moron . &quot;
We &apos;re in trouble .
What do you think , honey ? &quot;
If it doesn &apos;t work , take it down .
Thank you very much .
This is not a copy .
They would bring them back and mount them .
So that &apos;s for fun .
We &apos;re going to have some tomorrow .
You can walk through . You can touch .
So it &apos;s a leap of imagination .
TED is all about patterns in the clouds .
It &apos;s all about connections .
And I &apos;ll give you a quick example .
Thanks , Chris .
That &apos;s all true .
Guess what ?
Video games are a symptom .
The first is zero tolerance .
I mean , really .
&quot; Okay , what is she telling you to write ? &quot;
&quot; Poems . I have to write poems .
I don &apos;t want to write that stuff . &quot;
&quot; All right . Okay . &quot;
He &apos;s just a little boy .
Women are great . Yep , absolutely .
This is a place for girls .
Are there men around that table ?
It &apos;s coming from us .
Have you seen the ads ?
So what do we do ?
Do they make sense ?
It wasn &apos;t for me .
Thank you .
Now don &apos;t be shy .
It &apos;s an honor to be here .
Audience : Yeah .
Data : Here &apos;s the first one .
One of them falls to the ground .
He does not seem to be breathing .
What can I do ? &quot;
The operator says , &quot; Just take it easy .
I can help .
Anyone ?
That &apos;s all for now .
Was that okay for my first time ?
You &apos;ve been a great audience .
Thank you .
HK : Yay .
There &apos;s a lot more to come .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s a fantastic device .
And let me step back in time .
So this is really the enormous challenge that we have .
There is the problem . &quot;
So this is really what we &apos;re doing .
And this is a challenge .
This is a huge challenge for us to do that .
I want to look at the heart .
I want to look at the blood vessels . I want to look at the liver .
This is my daughter .
This is as of 9 a.m. this morning .
She &apos;s playing a computer game .
You can see that this is a full data &#91; set &#93; .
That &apos;s where those artifacts are coming from .
So this is from a virtual autopsy .
So this will be the typical workflow situation .
And the cause of death is the broken neck .
Here &apos;s another case .
Steve , I hope you &apos;re listening to this , all right .
It &apos;s really a hands-on experience .
So I can feel the skin .
So this is really nice .
So this is really neat .
He &apos;s seeing his own brain .
And then he &apos;s going backwards .
So he &apos;s going like this .
So here &apos;s a bear .
And here it is . Here is the nose of the bear .
So be aware of the bear .
So thank you very much .
And it was gut wrenching .
And so on , and so on .
That &apos;s not going to be changed at all .
It &apos;s true .
Thank you .
So , can we dare to be optimistic ?
That is a human tragedy .
What can we actually do ?
That was post-War Europe .
Now , today I &apos;m going to take just one of those four .
So , a mass of new discoveries .
So there &apos;s the optimism .
Will it be taken ?
And how about the long run ?
You go up in the short term , and then you go up even more in the long term .
Please , become ambassadors .
Thank you .
You will adapt to it and get used to it .
Now this does matter .
This is just completely ridiculous . &quot;
I &apos;ll figure something out .
Thank you so much .
We did it in three steps .
It turns out what we found was pretty surprising .
This blew our mind .
We didn &apos;t really understand that .
This wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
So what ?
So what &apos;s going on ?
What does it look like ?
The opposite happened .
The groups became stronger .
They became more robust .
I don &apos;t know what the answer is to that .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s set it to something else .
Thank you .
Can we all just close our eyes for a minute ?
It isn &apos;t some cultic thing .
So close your eyes for a minute .
It is endless .
Okay , open your eyes .
This is a dry lake bed .
And that was the pile , by the way .
Is there another way ?
The horizon .
It &apos;s an object for the mind .
Thank you very much .
They were trying to catch fish .
The children managed to run back onto the tracks .
It continued to rise .
Voice 2 : It &apos;s coming again ?
Voice 2 : Come get inside here .
Voice 1 : It &apos;s coming again . New wave !
A lot of people talk about ants .
Thank you very much .
Contagious is a good word .
Inspiration is contagious .
Is it luck ? Is it chance ?
That &apos;s them rolling .
Show us the grades . &quot;
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad .
&#91; Unclear &#93; So , the busiest streets closed down .
They are skating . They are doing street plays .
It was time now to infect India .
Infection in India .
Look at what their parents says .
This program is wonderful .
See ? They have done it .
Girl : Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
Girl : Are you ready ? Audience : Yes !
Girl : Are you ready ? Audience : Yes !
It was incredible .
So , if not us , then who ?
If not now , then when ?
Like I said , contagious is a good word .
Thank you .
I didn &apos;t follow along with the crowd .
I am a lesbian .
Thank you .
Just Morgana .
But I didn &apos;t .
Thank you .
Never have been .
Blackouts are not fun .
Could we leverage the cloud ?
This is the BRCK .
It &apos;s actually everywhere .
It is not without challenge .
&quot; What are you carrying ? &quot;
Thank you .
Another situation .
I could only find these ones .
Victoria ? Yes , correct .
That spike was all Victoria .
Hundreds ? One , three .
Thousand is getting better .
It was used indiscriminately .
She wasn &apos;t violent .
Same police district .
I checked the reports on this one .
Okay .
Thanks very much .
And let &apos;s pause here .
We could not believe it .
He is so excited . &quot;
This is a more competent version of it .
You can &apos;t quite stop .
This is just another one of the modules .
This is trigonometry .
This is shifting and reflecting functions .
And they all fit together .
Every row is a student .
Every column is one of those concepts .
and all of the rest .
They watched the video right over there .
They also got faster .
The height is how long it took them .
But this is all one system .
Thank you .
It &apos;s actually been pretty interesting .
It &apos;s been pretty crazy .
SK : Yeah , it &apos;s ready .
And the vision of the tutoring thing .
But yeah , it &apos;s all there .
Well , it &apos;s amazing .
Thank you .
This is Van Quach .
I went to Bhutan .
Wow , that &apos;s interesting .
Good question . But back to Bhutan .
I like it .
Co-branding opportunities .
Wow .
So how do we do that ?
That &apos;s about it .
Excuse that expression .
They aren &apos;t the same .
We count numbers .
We count on people .
Thank you very much .
Think about meaningful places .
The experience capital in the world of conferences .
All of these are experiences .
You Americans .
They say , you Americans .
and they realize , I &apos;m right !
Getting the commodities to market .
Are you rendering authenticity ?
The opposite , of course , is -- fake fake .
All right , now , there is value for fake .
Right ? Just wonderfully true to itself .
So , it &apos;s a fake real .
Think about Disney again .
For people to experience who you are .
Thank you .
But what is electrical resistance ?
Amazing . Thank you .
You understand &quot; forged currency , &quot; &quot; forged pictures . &quot;
My father is no such man .
Let me introduce him .
I heard him come in .
Indeed , it &apos;s rather small .
I was born in Algeria .
And indeed , I was very far from the mark .
These are real !
And then , suddenly , I went &quot; wow ! &quot;
My father , a secret agent ?
It was very James Bond .
His parents were of Russian descent .
Of course he knew .
But it was only the beginning .
That &apos;s my father .
He started making rubber stamps .
He was broke all of the time .
They are both in their sixties now .
And then he would not come .
Then one day he totally disappeared .
There was also Latin America .
Then there was the Vietnam War .
Europe was not spared either .
And those heroes did not need an army behind them .
He said no .
He &apos;s still dreaming about it .
Thank you .
Well , indeed , I &apos;m very , very lucky .
Are we alone ? &quot;
Now , the good news .
It &apos;s a new telescope .
There are small planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
And that &apos;s what the frustration was .
Am I that charming ?
This pixel is the Earth .
It is the Earth as we know it .
But it &apos;s really tiny .
We know that .
Can you imagine how small it is ?
Let me try it .
It is unimaginably small .
We can &apos;t imagine it .
But that &apos;s not the whole story , you see .
This is not insignificant .
This is very significant .
So what does this tell us ?
And let &apos;s do it .
Thank you very much .
Well , good morning .
Girls : Internet .
Girl 4 : I wouldn &apos;t like it .
Girl 2 : That would be so stressful .
Girl 5 : No .
PH : How come ?
Jay Forrester : Hello New York , this is Cambridge .
How &apos;s that ?
Journalist : What about that , Admiral ?
CB : Looks very good to me .
Here &apos;s their marketing video .
And then it would be too late to act .
In fact , despair is in the air .
And they fake it .
But all that was about to change .
There was women &apos;s liberation .
Here &apos;s the Apple marketing video .
And the forces of convergence exploded .
Voices 2 , 3 and 4 : With her ?
Thanks very much .
So many people are there .
The intensity of the upspring .
I love this picture .
Obviously , there &apos;s always the dark side of it .
Your father is murdered .
But there &apos;s so much potential .
He would say we are equal .
And that is something I will keep in my heart forever .
PM : I don &apos;t think so .
It was very hard at first .
Brought in more women .
The other thing is that it &apos;s about professionalism .
He has been very supportive of me .
And this is true .
And I am a role model in Yemen .
A lot of people look up to me .
We had some court cases .
My father was assassinated .
And that &apos;s not fair .
That thing .
Yeah , break dancing .
I &apos;m not so old .
I &apos;m just not in touch .
PM : Yes , you are .
It &apos;s natural .
And the very best of luck to you .
It arises around cracks in the Earth .
And they changed the atmosphere .
circuit boards of the future .
Water lilies were among the first .
Grasslands created opportunities .
And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds .
Thank you . Thank you .
Technology is broken .
Technology is inadequate .
How can this be ?
It &apos;s floppy like paper .
Next , dynamic interface .
Feels great .
Lisa Mallette : Oh my God .
Oh my God , I can &apos;t believe it .
Now , don &apos;t start running .
Try to walk right up the hill .
LM : Oh my God .
Is it pushing you up ?
It &apos;s pushing you right up .
Thank you .
Elliott and Nathan .
Why this might be the case ?
So here are a couple of examples .
&quot; Do you agree or disagree ? &quot;
Thank you .
Can we run that , Andrew ?
SP : I agree with the president .
So , what are the solutions ?
So , what are the solutions to this ?
And that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point .
They expect them to evaporate .
I hope they &apos;re right .
Number six : biotech disaster .
So , what do we do about that ?
Oh , and here &apos;s one other thing .
So , there &apos;s a fairly simple solution to this .
You don &apos;t need that much up there .
Number four : giant solar flares .
So , what can we do about this ?
Number three -- isn &apos;t this stuff cool ?
That was back when the population was around 100 million people .
So , what can we do about it ?
And also , space is incredibly vast .
And this is my scariest .
Could we have the solutions ?
We know about this stuff .
Knowledge is power .
Thank you .
We &apos;re just getting older .
These are major issues .
So , what can we do about it ?
That &apos;s a way to do it .
You see here a little video .
You see the scar form .
Actually , we can regenerate .
As you age , as you get older .
And you see that it is injured .
Then we can start to use cells .
It disintegrates a few months later .
What about other structures ?
This is actually an engineered blood vessel .
So , the bladder is one such organ .
This actually shows the scaffold .
It &apos;s true .
Same strategy .
And then the most complex are the solid organs .
It &apos;s now being seeded with cartilage .
We then start adding the muscle on top .
And that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing .
We are just taking five seconds .
Thank you for your attention .
This is the amino acid tryptophan .
But I didn &apos;t find any .
Really cool stuff .
You &apos;ve probably heard of it .
What about the clinic ?
There &apos;s just one problem .
Ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not being told .
Thank you .
12 to 15 launches per year .
Pilot : Release our fire .
Richard Searfoss : Good luck .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
If we can get the audio up ?
We &apos;re based down in Florida .
I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s great . &quot;
Well , it must be a good idea .
She said , &quot; Be good to your friends .
This is one of her songs .
Give him a big old hand .
One , two , three , four .
Hey , hey black-eyed Susie , hey .
A double outhouse over here on the side .
Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie , hey .
Hey , hey black-eyed Susie , hey .
Let &apos;s have the banjo .
One more time now .
Hey , hey , black-eyed Susie , hey .
Thank you , Michael .
This is Ralph Stanley .
I fell in love with that .
It sounds something like this .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind . &quot;
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
And pretty much never did .
You sing : Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Let &apos;s try it one more time .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
And I don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
I set that whole thing up .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
Good news : Chariot &apos;s coming .
And I don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect .
Well , I hear you &apos;re having trouble .
Open up now .
They were about my age .
Through the garage .
No problem . Yeah , you know . &quot;
I call this Thunderwear .
Thank you , folks .
This is from July , 1969 .
The world was changing .
He said -- think about this one .
We knew it wasn &apos;t lung cancer .
So I went in for an ultrasound .
My wife came with me .
This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be .
And there were actually two of these .
I went home .
How does that happen ?
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; What the heck ? &quot;
This was bad .
Her boyfriend was with her .
It &apos;s really serious .
How amazing is that ?
Here &apos;s the thing .
So we went into it .
Don &apos;t worry about the numbers .
You see , that &apos;s the immune system .
Just incredible .
And it goes like this .
Well thank you . That shot the timing .
It &apos;s not my data .
So she took it .
She pulled up the CD .
Raw data now . &quot;
Let patients help .
Let patients help .
Let patients help .
Thank you .
Perfectly ordinary scientific paper .
That &apos;s inconceivable , of course .
He really meant it .
Well , so much for quantity . How about quality ?
And again , it will need money .
Thank you very much .
Also the visual separation .
The architect lost here .
Moving along to Lincoln Center .
Before and after shot .
But one more added feature .
Thank you very much .
Now , nobody wants an operation .
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation .
Nobody wants an operation .
So this is gallbladder surgery .
Surgeons are not made either .
And when they do all of that for about five years , they get the coveted board certification .
It &apos;s hard .
No , we just said all surgeons .
Very inspiring .
Let me bring it to you locally .
I work at the Cambridge Hospital .
So we need tools .
And it has to be bi-directional .
It &apos;s a big task .
I need to have a health care lexicon .
This is research -- can &apos;t buy it .
We work with a fourth technology .
Module five : manual skills practice .
But that &apos;s the lectures .
This is how you hold the needle .
Grab the needle at the tip .
It &apos;s important to be accurate .
Aim for the black dots .
Now go ahead and cut .
Very good Oscar . I &apos;ll see you next week .
We want it to be bi-directional .
We have a need to learn as well as to teach .
Thank you very much .
And this is when it really gets interesting .
What about the domestication of grains ?
What about the origins of agriculture ?
It was really bad news .
And that &apos;s all very true .
They were very conscious .
That was the Paige typesetter .
It could benefit from tragedies .
What does this mean ?
Think of the financial world , for example .
Thank you very much .
Thank you !
I &apos;ve recorded lots of CDs .
And she said , just talk about yourself .
That &apos;s how we met .
You tell them .
NM : You want to or no ?
And I said , &quot; I know you .
That &apos;s it .
I starts out with a slow air .
We just started yesterday .
NM : With one minute .
NM : I &apos;m not tuned . Hold on .
We &apos;ve got another 10 minutes .
NM : Okay . Sure .
All right , okay .
Let &apos;s get her going .
DL : What do you want to play ?
NM : Well , um ...
NM : Uh , sure .
DL : How fast ?
NM : Not too fast .
Anyway , I &apos;m blabbering on here .
DL : No surgeries , oh yeah .
I like it .
Will we play a tune ?
NM : It worked . DL : It worked .
Okay , play in , how about A ?
So let &apos;s start talking about that .
And somehow it will all make sense .
One is leverage .
And your friendly Citibank had 47 times .
Oops .
It ain &apos;t pretty .
We &apos;re going to start to pay them .
Right ?
Here &apos;s his first bit of advice .
And here &apos;s his second bit of advice .
This is an actual bill .
And it &apos;s 10 triliion dollars .
The orange slice is what &apos;s discretionary .
Everything else is mandated .
Sixty-eight is young today .
I got what you &apos;re thinking .
That &apos;s the financial crisis .
And start building stuff .
First they don &apos;t grow .
Then they grow exponentially .
Then they stop growing .
They started competing .
It &apos;s almost like leaving Congress .
You re-grow a set of teeth .
This is kind of getting boring , right ?
But , I mean it gets more interesting .
Life happens .
Third trend : robots .
Didn &apos;t happen .
Very primitive .
It is common for hominids to evolve .
Ta-dah !
Maybe not .
Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;ll play it one more time .
And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time .
And so we struck up a deal .
It &apos;s a very beautiful structure .
And I &apos;ll just do that one more time .
And again , we were in for a surprise .
And that was what really got me puzzled .
Audience : Wow .
And what that is , is cavitation .
And if I could share the image with you on the screen .
So three things have happened .
The bubbles are the countries .
There was a huge difference in the world .
And this is what happens .
Because this is where we are .
I cover my lifetime here , you know ?
I expect to live 100 years .
And this is where we are today .
We &apos;ll swap the axis .
And this is GDP per capita on this axis .
This is India coming up , with the first data from India .
Let us have a look at the United States .
And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today .
Chile &apos;s catching up !
And I want to look at Sweden and the United States .
And here we go . Here we go .
And the Volvo is doing quite fine .
They really caught up .
And this is my family .
I told you last year , I &apos;ll tell you again , my mother was born in Egypt , and I -- who am I ?
I &apos;m the Mexican in the family .
But they &apos;re very small , you know ?
Carbon-dioxide emission , metric ton per capita .
And what happens when we moved on ?
And this is really what has to be changed .
And here it &apos;s a much nicer bedroom , you can see .
And this is the sofa , how it will emerge from there .
This can change . This can change .
We can get out of poverty .
It &apos;s about having food .
That &apos;s one context .
Getting out of poverty .
He knows everything .
But you can do that .
What is this , what is this , what am I telling ?
I &apos;m telling you that there are many dimensions of development .
Let me first grade what are the most important means .
Environment is important .
We are not interested in money .
And that &apos;s good , it gets two plusses .
Environment is very , very crucial .
Of course , it &apos;s human rights .
That &apos;s the value of living .
Even African countries can achieve this .
We can have a good world .
Bring me my sword !
Sword swallowing is from ancient India .
It &apos;s a great honor to be here with you .
And he said , &quot; Ceramics . And who are you ? &quot;
And the Bishop adopted me as his kid .
That &apos;s the building .
That &apos;s intentional .
That happens to be at Christmas time .
And he said , &quot; But we &apos;ve heard about you .
And we &apos;ve never looked back .
That happens to be our cafeteria line .
They have no calories .
That &apos;s our dining room .
No big deal .
We teach photography .
And these are examples of some of the kids &apos; work .
This is our gallery .
And I said , &quot; Bill , I want to hire you , man .
So , I came to give you a ride . &quot;
This is brand new .
And I said , &quot; Well , what do you do for a living ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Well , I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard . &quot;
She said , &quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
I said , &quot; You &apos;re the gift . &quot;
And I want my music to be with you . &quot;
And that worked out all right .
And there &apos;s the fountain .
And Mellon Bank &apos;s a tenant .
And this is in the process of being built as we speak .
Thank you very much for that . &quot;
And finally , there &apos;s this picture .
This is in a place called San Francisco .
My name &apos;s Willie Brown . &quot;
And now I really want to build one . &quot;
He said , &quot; San Francisco . &quot;
I said , &quot; Any chance you know Willie Brown ? &quot;
I want to help you . &quot;
What do you do for a living ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s very nice .
I &apos;m going with you , man . &quot;
I believe in you .
And I don &apos;t think I &apos;m crazy .
In my business it &apos;s very difficult work .
And thanks for listening to what I had to say .
Well , it &apos;s got to do with your brain .
And the answer : before their first birthdays .
So there are two things going on .
English has a lot of Rs and Ls .
The distribution shows .
So this is little Emma .
She &apos;s a six-monther .
What are we seeing ?
We &apos;re seeing the baby brain .
Thank you .
Can that possibly be true ?
How does it work ?
God damn it .
J Yep .
You &apos;re clear . All right . Firing .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
Light &apos; em all up .
C &apos;mon , fire !
Keep shoot &apos; n . Keep shoot &apos; n .
Keep shoot &apos; n .
Roger . I got &apos; em .
I mean , did he ?
J Yeah .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
Light is good .
Dangerous troublemaker .
Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
What is this ?
Is it really yours ? &quot;
Yeah .
That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
That &apos;s a problem .
Can that be right ?
J What , the movie business ?
J Well , I was a journalist .
Wow .
They &apos;re feedback loops .
And I &apos;m going to demonstrate for you .
That &apos;s what it feels like to me .
It &apos;s not pleasant .
So that &apos;s getting a little more closer to a personal experience .
That &apos;s the thing .
All right .
It doesn &apos;t have a name yet .
All right .
So there is a catch . There is a catch .
Xu Liu : Test mice .
As simple as that .
SR : Are you convinced ?
But memory is not .
XL : Yep . You heard it right .
It &apos;s interesting .
Clearly it &apos;s freezing .
We &apos;re really excited about this .
Yes we can .
SR : So how do we do this ?
So Ozzie , Harriet and me .
You &apos;re all welcome to join .
We often think linearly .
Now , I &apos;ve gained some insight into this .
Now I mentioned the phone .
Let &apos;s start with faster .
How do you leverage that information ?
And of course , there &apos;s an app for that .
You can step on the scale .
But it &apos;s going to be here .
We can capture that information .
Thanks very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Take a bow . Take a bow .
I think -- how can this possibly be ?
And so it gets down to the brain .
Now the way that &apos;s done is by the following .
And so , I have here what we call the &quot; paradigms . &quot;
That was not what was going on .
It &apos;s kind of fun actually .
That was challenging .
Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant .
He &apos;s just memorized a rhyme for us .
Ray Kurzweil : A university for the coming singularity
There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth .
And I was asked , &quot; Well aren &apos;t you nervous ?
But we more than make up for that .
This is a completely different example .
This is not Moore &apos;s Law .
The cost has come down by half every year .
This is deeply democratizing .
Well this is a logarithmic graph .
Here is our founding meeting .
But this is being announced today .
That &apos;s the honest truth .
It went right into my heart .
So what has changed ?
And that gave me a lot of hope . Okay ?
My brain started thinking .
But what if this wasn &apos;t the first time ?
I &apos;m serious now .
They &apos;ve had bailouts in London .
They &apos;ve had bailouts in Europe .
It &apos;s a not-for-profit blog that I run .
This is the other context .
What are the figures he &apos;s relying on ?
The name of the person doesn &apos;t matter .
Okay ? His name isn &apos;t important .
Fantastic .
It &apos;s been ignored .
And this is my reality check .
We will continue to press on .
I could see what you &apos;re applying for .
Okay .
Through my work , I &apos;ve been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this .
As you can see with your own eyes .
And there is thousands of these .
So what does this all mean ?
We can inspire each other .
I felt misled .
This is a disaster .
Thank you very much .
I grew up in a musical family .
And dance has progressed .
Online videos and social networking ...
And this is happening every day .
Ladies and gentlemen : The LXD .
Thank you .
It was before the avian flu had reached Europe .
I &apos;ll see what I can do . OK ?
Next best thing to a video game .
And this .
Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system .
I mean , there are certainly plenty of them around .
I think that &apos;s wonderful .
There &apos;s going to have to be moral progress .
Doing the best I can , OK .
I &apos;m just doing what I can here .
I mean , what do you do ?
Thanks .
In this case , it &apos;s very simple .
Well we can begin to ask those questions also .
This may be surprising .
So this is very surprising .
Did we mix or not ?
And that &apos;s indeed the case .
Well I don &apos;t think that is the case .
Thank you for your attention .
They &apos;re going to be small .
OK ?
Here &apos;s my parody and it ain &apos;t much of one .
That &apos;s the problem .
But they said to us , &quot; You know what ?
They said no .
It &apos;s just too damn hard .
I call that the Leviathan Force .
I call them the System Administrators .
What can they do ?
They can indict your ass .
But here &apos;s the deal .
That &apos;s called the Powell Doctrine .
What are we missing ?
What do you get then ?
You &apos;re America . &quot;
All security dominated .
You will get this model .
You tell me it &apos;s too hard to do .
We did it just like that .
Would you like Mugabe gone ?
I &apos;m talking about the 1990s .
Ah !
Most of them don &apos;t pick up a rifle .
Everybody &apos;s got an opinion .
Security has meant everything else .
That &apos;s the scary part .
I supported the war in Iraq .
This is the Hobbesian Force .
What does this mean ?
Switching back , morning , afternoon , evening , morning , afternoon , evening .
It &apos;s too much .
You need the experience .
What does this mean in terms of operations ?
The rule is going to be this .
You &apos;re not going to get away from that .
We &apos;re done with that .
Sys Admin Force has to .
Do we need a bigger budget ?
Absolutely not .
Here &apos;s the larger point .
Last slide .
Bad news is they may not have anybody on them . &quot;
Armor goes this way .
Shinseki was right with the argument .
Trigger-pullers go this way .
Return to the Army .
I was never here .
The world is my playground .
This is not about money .
It &apos;s not secret .
Take a gift in the left hand .
Thanks .
So , back to Mars .
So , what about life on Mars ?
How do you plan to look for it ?
We can see them .
These are hopping microbot swarms .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s start with mortgages .
Anyone ? Wonderful .
Anyone ?
No one .
What about the remaining half of the people ?
They &apos;re just too lazy .
One third of Americans .
Are they saving enough ?
Let &apos;s look at that .
Wonderful .
Twelve percent do .
What &apos;s the difference ?
Nobody checks boxes .
That &apos;s kind of too much effort .
Doing nothing is very common .
Inertia , lack of action .
Very powerful .
And checking the box takes effort .
They &apos;re really mad .
It &apos;s an autopilot .
And here are the results .
It &apos;s real .
This is a real difference .
Let me wrap with two key messages .
This is really the tip of the iceberg .
One , two , three , four .
Thank you .
And does it matter ? &quot; Thank you . Does it matter ?
Thank you very much . And that &apos;s more than enough .
&quot; That misses the point . &quot;
And you know what ?
I think this was truly fantastic .
And it &apos;s fantastic .
And I was like , &quot; Why ? &quot;
So it &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s very hard to get , of course .
They &apos;re not going to get rid of us .
I want it to keep flying .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s just going to get more wild .
There will be no exceptions to that .
This has been fantastic .
We have machines that go ping .
There &apos;s many of them up there .
I was called down to the ward to see him .
He said , &quot; Look , there &apos;s a guy down here .
One in a hundred .
Enjoying it so far ?
I &apos;m sorry to say that .
She looks terrified .
It &apos;s an amazing picture .
And this is the small idea .
So that &apos;s the little idea .
Yeah , yeah . Sure . &quot;
She founded the hospice movement .
Thank you .
He named it homunculus .
It &apos;s you . It &apos;s me .
Marketing creates user groups .
Maybe the silence .
So I worked with white noise .
This is white noise .
And this noise is the most neutral .
It seems to be magic .
And in mine , I hope .
It works .
It &apos;s too in silence .
So imagine , for instance , you are at home .
So , a huge problem .
And we build the project to the end .
I just do that to make money .
We took irregular dosage .
This one is an antibiotic .
So the first day , this is the big one .
And you have to peel and eat one layer a day .
Thank you .
I remember the day of the opening .
I was a little bit late .
And this is exactly the same at home .
So let &apos;s have a look at your home .
So this is the final object .
And it includes some fishes as well .
After that you have two options .
Amazing channel .
Or you start fishing .
Because you can grow some potatoes .
See , like this one ?
You can see it there .
Just for my workshop .
Thank you very much .
So those who are &quot; yes , &quot; raise your hand . &quot; For . &quot;
Okay , hands down .
Those who are against , raise your hands .
The power lines are getting overloaded .
And you peak out .
This is one from Toshiba .
They &apos;re referred to as nuclear batteries .
Okay . Okay .
One is a low estimate , and one is a high estimate .
would be this .
So then here &apos;s the final ranking .
All right .
That &apos;s from real data .
There &apos;s absolutely no need for nuclear power .
I &apos;ve come around in the last 10 years .
The first is : be aware of the propaganda .
Secondly , think about this .
Thank you .
For .
Anyone else for ? Go .
Thank you .
Anyone else against ?
I will also add one other thing .
Point well made . Thank you .
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.
And there &apos;s much more solar than there is wind .
Okay . So , thank you , Mark .
Ooooh .
Now that is -- my take on that ...
Okay . So here &apos;s the read on it .
Thank you for that .
But I was intrigued .
How much oil is stored in all of China ?
So now we had our constraint .
Thank you .
OK , clap them together , once .
OK , reverse your hands .
Yours is the other way around , so swap it around .
All right . Tap them together once .
And she was completely blind .
There we go .
I &apos;m going to guide you into the car .
KT : Yes .
KT : No .
KT : No .
And I &apos;m going to try that right now .
KB : Are you ready ?
Where is it ? There &apos;s no way ...
KB : Look at the road , look at the road .
KB : Sure there &apos;s not ?
I &apos;m looking at the road , all the time .
Oh , my God !
KB : What ?
We &apos;re OK , though ?
KT : Yes .
That &apos;s so weird .
Oh , my God !
KB : And I &apos;ve stopped .
You &apos;re like a freak-ass of nature .
KB : Thank you .
That &apos;s the question .
Can you come up ?
Do you mind ?
Yes , at the end .
Your name is ?
Is it a girl ?
They &apos;ve already gone .
KB : Oh , they &apos;re gone , OK .
OK , a little bit closer .
A little bit closer .
Come in a little bit closer .
Nicole : No .
KB : Voodoo ?
Nicole : No .
Nicole : No .
Nicole : Yes .
KB : How many times did you feel it ?
Nicole : Twice .
Extend your left arm , OK .
OK , keep it there .
Did you feel anything , there ?
Nicole : Yes .
KB : What did you feel ?
Nicole : Yes .
I never touched you .
A voodoo experiment .
You just take a seat over here for a second .
Sit right here .
OK .
KB : OK , take a seat . Excellent , OK .
Close your eyes right now .
Excellent .
OK , now , allow it to stay there .
Do you understand ?
Yes .
KB : Hold it right there .
Can you stand up ?
OK , let &apos;s try it again .
Point directly at his forehead .
OK , it worked that time , excellent .
You can wait as long as you want .
OK , you can go back .
Do you want to try it ?
Good job .
She &apos;s not taking any chances .
Come right over here , next to me .
Excellent .
Now , have a look at the Coke bottle .
Be careful .
Excellent .
Now , hold it out here .
I &apos;m trying to be good here .
OK , drop it in .
Have you got his name ?
There &apos;s five letters in the title .
Think of one of the letters .
Was that his name ?
Nicole : Mm-hmm .
Thank you .
Oh , OK .
You knew !
There you are , OK .
One , two , three and four .
Happy ?
OK , and tell me when you &apos;re done .
You done ?
SJ : Mmm , almost .
So , all right , we &apos;ll leave them like that .
I &apos;m going to have the last laugh , though .
No , stay around , OK .
SJ : Put this on ?
SJ : Um , um .
KB : No ?
KB : You can &apos;t see through it . Excellent , OK .
Now , I &apos;m going to put on the blindfold .
Don &apos;t stack them up , OK .
Give them an extra mix up .
I &apos;ll put the blindfold on .
Give them an extra mix up .
No messing around this time .
OK , go ahead , mix them up .
Tell me when you &apos;re done .
SJ : Done .
Your right hand . Is that -- no , OK .
Tell me when I &apos;m over a cup .
SJ : Mm-hmm .
SJ : Oh !
SJ : I don &apos;t think it &apos;s there .
KB : No ? Good decision .
SJ : OK .
KB : There ?
SJ : Yes , there &apos;s one .
SJ : I &apos;m going to say no .
KB : Good decision .
OK , give me both hands .
SJ : Uh , neither .
KB : Neither , oh , OK .
But if you were to guess .
Have a look .
SJ : Oh !
KB : Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
That is a huge transformation .
And this is what changed .
That &apos;s one of the big changes .
Second story .
They were taking videos of buildings shaking .
They were Twittering it .
And this stuff rippled like wildfire .
And then this happened .
And so the protest kept going .
That was enough of citizen media .
And in fact that is happening this week .
And here is the twentieth century answer .
National message . Targeted individuals .
Relatively sparse number of producers .
All of that is over .
The audience can talk back .
Those days are over , never to return .
I &apos;m going to vote for this bill . &quot;
He had to issue a reply .
Thank you very much .
This is far too simplistic .
Why should I know this ?
Thank you so much .
Yang Lan : The generation that &apos;s remaking China
Guess who was the performing guest ?
Susan Boyle .
It means &quot; green onion for free . &quot;
Why did she say that ?
That was hilarious .
Well , being different is not that difficult .
It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
It is still boiling .
On Tencent , 200 million .
So how are they different ?
College graduates are not in short supply .
They &apos;re not rich at all .
Thank you very much .
Will you fly back to the U.S. , Germany , Europe ?
This is what &apos;s going on .
What are the risk factors ?
20 percent are getting treated .
So , they spend their money trying to fix those problems .
You can &apos;t raise money .
We make sure that we select our equipment properly .
We made sure that we produced some things ourselves .
We get the generators from the companies .
But you know , they have that luxury .
When we do it , we will put the cost of care down .
And everyone will get the care they deserve .
Thank you .
We are totally closed .
And I get , over time , bored by them .
And they rang very true for me .
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays .
Every single dog on one tee shirt .
And then just leave it all to them .
And I don &apos;t have to do anything .
So I looked for furniture .
It &apos;s not quite finished yet .
Then there is a coffee table . I also did a coffee table .
It &apos;s called Be Here Now .
So I will not really go too far into it .
There is some good successes .
That &apos;s about five percent of everybody .
What came out of it ?
I really got close to design again .
I had fun .
That &apos;s connected to a scanner .
On one hand I have nothing against selling .
My parents are both salespeople .
I &apos;ll just show two now .
This is after a week .
After two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
I think you see , you see them sweeping . You see them sweeping right here .
They weren &apos;t quite slick enough .
And I think she overdid it .
Just a bit too ornamental .
So it &apos;s going to be a while .
Stefan Sagmeister : Thank you .
There &apos;s a group of people in Kenya .
These people are tall .
And they kill lions .
These are the Maasais .
The girls are brought up to be mothers .
Cool , yeah ?
Why did she say that ?
He came home once a year .
We didn &apos;t see him for sometimes even two years .
She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us .
I wanted to become a teacher .
Teachers looked nice .
Well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass .
I did . The ceremony happened .
They were all in a circle .
And I sat down , and I opened my legs .
We were taken care of .
And I told him , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that part .
This gentleman , he helped me .
They all came together .
I found snow !
Those things made me angry .
I wanted to do something .
I had to do something .
She &apos;s beaten .
We have .
A transformation had begun in her life .
I want to challenge you today .
You are somebody who is so passionate .
You are somebody who wants to make a difference .
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better .
The first is Bharti Kher .
Thank you very much for looking and listening .
He wanted to shake the President &apos;s hand .
Here &apos;s the crux of the obstacle .
They cannot replace government .
They deserve a hand .
Thank you .
We just did not know .
Thank you .
Cheese ? I love cheese !
I really love cheese sandwiches . &quot;
And so Ivan goes to get a drink .
This pirate is called Joshua .
So , that one is his .
And then his went on the ground .
Which sandwich is he going to take ?
And he takes this one .
His was on the grass .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Um , yeah .
Okay . Good .
Woman : Ready , Rebecca ? RS : Yes .
Thank you .
They really are calling ?
RS : Yeah , we worry about this .
Why ?
There is .
It &apos;s called oxytocin .
It can &apos;t be that important . &quot;
There must be a reason why . &quot;
First of all , oxytocin is a shy molecule .
I think I can do that .
So I started smaller .
But I &apos;m also a skeptic .
You only do it one time .
That &apos;s not what we found .
But why ?
Two things .
&quot; Well this is very valuable .
So I said , &quot; I &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot;
We call them bastards .
And we have testosterone .
I didn &apos;t know a single person .
And guess what ?
The bride .
Her mother , that &apos;s right .
Her mother was number two .
For example , through social media .
They checked .
There you go . That &apos;s connection .
Come here . Give me a hug .
There you go .
Thank you .
And the car sped off .
That &apos;s the shooter I saw that killed the father . &quot;
So what &apos;s wrong ?
Oh yes , no gun was ever found .
So what &apos;s the problem ?
It &apos;s called reconstructed memories .
Well , what &apos;s that got to do with this ?
That &apos;s 30 feet away .
Okay . There &apos;s 15 feet .
And that &apos;s what he saw .
Why did I take the risk ?
This is what he saw .
Which they decided not to .
He is now a freed man .
They &apos;re dynamic .
Thank you .
And this gets me back to my research .
There are 10 million people in the U.S.
Here you have a retina .
Anyway , you get the idea .
How important is this ?
It &apos;s called &quot; We Feel Fine . &quot;
&quot; I feel good . &quot;
&quot; I feel pretty . &quot;
&quot; I feel sassy . &quot;
That was the first concept here .
We &apos;re very used to this .
That &apos;s &quot; Moby Dick . &quot;
This is the food we ate .
It &apos;s baleen . Moving on .
He wanted to help poor people .
A 16-year-old quarry worker .
A 16-year-old student .
She wanted a change in her life .
It was all good-natured .
A 10-year-old .
A 37-year-old road worker .
Thank you .
You &apos;re most welcome .
Thanks very much .
But that &apos;s not always the case .
Thank you .
All right . One , two , three .
Audience : What are you reading ?
Ow ! Ow !
They begin with a question .
Okay ?
It &apos;s play .
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
Student : There &apos;s two up there .
And three in here .
They say no .
What was the feedback like ?
And I &apos;ll just read one .
Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . Yeah yeah . Okay .
And you like technology , right ?
Now ...
Okay .
Everyone over there shout .
Where &apos;s the sound coming from ?
Thank you very much .
So , Amy ?
I &apos;m 43 years old right now .
Would you like to see destruction ?
This is what happened in Tunisia .
They found something called Twitter .
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues .
And now Libya as you see it .
And then you have Yemen .
They have lost .
We do not create revolutions .
I thank you very much .
Thank you for coming here .
We have covered many wars .
Thank you so much .
A marvelous place .
Very few things went to the market .
There I learned different things .
I &#91; went to &#93; university to become an economist .
Brazil radicalized very strongly .
But I did much more than that .
I put photography as my life .
I lost my faith in our species .
I started to have infection everywhere .
You must stop . Stop .
And I made the decision to stop .
It became a national park .
Well , this — — Thank you . Thank you very much .
A lack of oxygen in the water .
There are thousands of trees .
Thank you very much .
Think about that .
They had BlackBerries .
He was not a schoolteacher .
Terrorists are doing this .
Think about that .
They don &apos;t all have drumsticks .
Perhaps like this .
Criminals understand this .
But this is not going to work .
Thank you .
Eve Ensler : What security means to me
And that &apos;s actually the good news .
In order to be secure , you defend against &quot; them . &quot;
She &apos;s a high school student .
All of us are refugees .
Thank you very much .
Why this one ?
Catherine Mohr : The tradeoffs of building green
First of all , I &apos;m a geek .
For example : Is this evil ?
Wipe it up , throw it away .
And now all bets are off .
Except for flooring .
So what does this mean ?
Thank you .
Oh yeah , oh yeah . Oh yeah .
CC : Yeah .
What ?
Yeah . Three is a magic number .
Three is a groovin &apos; number .
And counting off by four ?
Well , look , think of it this way .
And so does a 4 / 4 measure of music .
It has four quarter notes .
Now , how do you subdivide ?
And listen to this .
All right , second line .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three .
One-two-three-four , one-two-three . Yeah .
One , two , one , two , a-one-two-three-four .
Yeah . Mm .
Aha .
CC : Yeah . Hip-hop .
All : Triplet-triplet .
A-rhythm-etic .
I &apos;m a neuroscientist .
There is no other reason to have a brain .
Think about it .
There &apos;s no competition at all .
And she &apos;s pretty happy .
And it sounds like an easy problem .
It changes over time .
So let &apos;s think about the inference .
So what are beliefs ?
And here &apos;s inside the brain .
And the game is very simple .
But we &apos;ve got a problem .
Maybe there &apos;s variation in the population .
Thank you very much .
So what about circuit breakers ?
Hmmm ...
Thank you .
It &apos;s a pretty expensive machine .
And everything began pretty auspiciously .
The nurse was there .
There has to be something better . &quot;
Voila !
Here she is .
Everything else is the same .
And it &apos;s by design .
And finally , it &apos;s affordable .
Is it working ?
Is this the design that &apos;s going to work in place ?
So we &apos;re thrilled .
Who gets surgery and who doesn &apos;t ?
Thank you very much .
Some are actually on the brink of extinction .
Thank you .
It &apos;s called &quot; All the Answers . &quot;
That &apos;s the first time I &apos;ve ever played it .
One thing is , it &apos;s unpronounceable .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tembererana . &quot;
First of all -- any questions so far ?
So the reading would be over very quickly .
You won &apos;t be familiar with it .
Yeah , I kind of felt sorry for him .
And I can show here a very good example .
It &apos;s a picture by Paul Klee .
Yeah , that &apos;s great .
What can you say ? What a mess .
And that &apos;s really advanced tidying up .
This is a picture by Joan Miro .
It &apos;s more economical and also more efficient .
One , two , three .
Yeah , it &apos;s a -- this one here , that &apos;s much better .
I think it doesn &apos;t matter .
So , I mean , this picture has not even got a proper title .
This is Keith Haring looked at statistically .
And here , that &apos;s one of my favorites .
Yeah , at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming .
It &apos;s -- oh , no , it &apos;s -- that &apos;s a really hard one .
And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up .
And now they &apos;re all in here .
I mean , it &apos;s &quot; the future we will create . &quot;
I just piled them up .
And I started to bring some order into some flags .
And then maybe before I leave you ...
Thank you very much .
In fact , I &apos;ll let them tell you a bit more about it .
This is the old economy .
And it &apos;s going to change the world as we know it .
It &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music .
It includes things like the Internet cables .
It &apos;s all right there .
That &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
We look at the internet .
We use a lot of search .
You need a guide .
I know Amira .
It &apos;s called &quot; Dhani Tackles the Globe . &quot;
He finds a local sporting team .
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing .
My challenge instead is this .
We have to fix our media .
We have to fix our immigration policy .
You . Yeah .
You know who you are .
Perk up .
Oh , and that &apos;s not even the tip of the iceberg .
Here we go .
This little baby has a lot of horsepower .
Go figure .
Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you .
Your pets are happier than you are .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s hard to imagine or measure .
But -- you know what I &apos;m say &apos;n ?
That &apos;s French science .
Okay , here we go .
Tomorrow is another day .
It &apos;s believable , it &apos;s tactile .
This is my final piece .
So please , without further ado .
Thank you .
This is a fun one .
It goes like this .
Here we go .
Okay , that still works . Okay , good .
All right , here we go .
Here we go .
The answer is ?
No , they &apos;re not the same .
We &apos;ve got to make it happen .
He &apos;s absolutely right .
Thank you , thank you .
The year is 1987 .
But this is not an ancient conflict .
But some want war .
Who will risk peace ?
You make it with your enemies . &quot;
Thank you .
What is it that we &apos;re concerned about ?
Alright , so I &apos;ve got you nervous .
And we have spent a lot of money .
And you &apos;ll have massive competition .
What about quarantine ?
Nobody was processing the credit cards .
Your insurance payments didn &apos;t go through .
It wasn &apos;t flying microbes .
And the rules and the belief systems were wildly disparate .
It was likened to the plague .
So are we ready ?
How many masks do you need ?
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s rational .
Otherwise you &apos;re in trouble .
Can you talk about that ?
The mechanism isn &apos;t clear .
Is that likely , do you think , here ?
Again we don &apos;t really know for sure .
And yes they die , drowning in their own fluids , of pneumonia .
And I think my time is up . I thank you all for your attention .
This is Vannevar Bush .
Now this was in 1945 .
He built a system .
And this is Doug Engelbart .
And he works this system .
So this is Doug Engelbart .
And this began to get a head of steam .
The magazines started to cover it .
So we didn &apos;t do it .
But is he happy ?
This is the launch of my book .
That doesn &apos;t make any sense .
And so they also reconcile with sex .
But the principle is exactly the same .
So these are the pillars of morality .
these are the two factors that always come out .
And the other one is empathy and compassion .
So let me give you a few examples here .
And so they &apos;re bringing in the box .
And you can see that they &apos;re synchronized .
He takes basically everything .
So there are two interesting parts about this .
So it &apos;s actually fairly simple for them .
There they are .
And so that &apos;s how they bring it in .
But now we &apos;re going to make it more difficult .
So it &apos;s what we call freeloading .
This was the cooperation , reciprocity part .
Now something on empathy .
And empathy has sort of two qualities .
And the emotional part .
And so empathy has basically two channels .
One is the body channel .
Your average dog has that also .
And that &apos;s more limited .
And it &apos;s related to empathy .
So it is connected .
And so that &apos;s how they live .
So they have a whole bucket full of them .
You will see how that goes .
that this is not a good test for her .
So it doesn &apos;t matter whatsoever .
The first piece she eats .
And that &apos;s what she does .
The other one sees that .
She tests a rock now against the wall .
She needs to give it to us .
And she gets cucumber again .
So let me summarize .
And I thank you for your attention .
That &apos;s clearly not true .
And that &apos;s not really the case either .
That &apos;s the real thing .
That &apos;s another story , perhaps .
So the knowledge generates ignorance .
It &apos;s rather kind of the other way around , really .
It &apos;s what makes a good question .
How about the visual system ?
There it is , the visual system .
How do we do that ?
They &apos;re interested .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And we have to resist to the changes .
We have to keep everything under control .
How do we steer a balloon ?
It &apos;s not true .
This is very practical .
This can be in politics .
This can be in spirituality .
But sometimes it &apos;s very paradoxical .
That &apos;s a crisis .
You need 64 meter wingspan .
That &apos;s for sure .
Cockpit , propeller , engine .
This is the complete structure of the airplane .
This is not an airplane .
This is acceptable .
I could have told them that .
That &apos;s reassuring .
It was half as long .
And it is certainly a wonder .
That &apos;s 3.2 billion people .
It &apos;s not sustainable .
They &apos;ve gotten bigger ; they &apos;re spread out .
The 20 largest cities in the world .
And what was I -- you know , how are you going to say anything ?
And so I said , &quot; Sure . &quot;
And the camera is looking down at her .
Not much has changed .
We need water .
I better shut up .
It was a historical day .
Space-time underwent a phase transition .
I don &apos;t think so .
Thank you .
This is where it began .
Until it was stripped from me , I never thought about it .
These are just some examples .
That statistic is so sad .
Here &apos;s my brain .
The first C is cognitive training .
Let &apos;s just talk about full-scale I.Q.
And you can see here there are three columns .
This is not supposed to occur .
And this person is particularly interesting .
This affected my entire body .
That tiny misalignment .
I still had migraine headaches .
That &apos;s basically it .
This is it being held in the hand .
It weighs less than a gram .
Where does it go inside the body ?
Here are the implantation sites .
The main unit will then go inside the brain .
Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know what I had in my mind .
And he was walking around .
And we have his book outside in the bookshop .
And it works . It works .
It works .
I should clarify that .
The audience is too small .
He &apos;s a very , very remarkable man .
He &apos;s done a lot of very cutting-edge science .
Thank you . Thank you .
Well , there &apos;s also another interesting thing .
It &apos;s an open-source project .
So this one is a quadcopter .
In a way , it &apos;s a toy , no ?
MB : Check this out .
So , yeah .
Then we have this plant here .
This is a pH probe .
What am I supposed to excite , huh ?
Thank you .
And thanks to the community .
Thank you so much .
And these are just some of the examples .
Coffee both causes and prevents cancer .
So , &quot; Red wine can help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
And here &apos;s another example .
And they very helpfully tell you how to go and find the paper .
And they said , &quot; We &apos;ve done a trial .
That should always ring alarm bells .
So this is what they were going to do in their trial .
Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design ?
So there &apos;s no control ; there &apos;s no control group .
But that sounds really techie .
That &apos;s a technical term .
What else could it possibly be if it wasn &apos;t the pills ?
But that &apos;s not enough .
So how does this work ?
This is something called funnel plot .
So they all cluster together .
Well they &apos;re heinous , they really are .
This is a drug called reboxetine .
I found no flaw .
And this is not an isolated story .
Thank you very much .
Same was true for China .
In the north , there was a great wall , Chang Cheng .
And now the result is very simple .
It became the media .
The server is in Beijing .
So , what &apos;s the future ?
After all , we are the mouse .
Thank you .
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth .
We share in common the same pathogens .
These are little wells .
The mycelium is sentient .
It knows that you are there .
How is that possible ?
It was called Prototaxites .
All across most land masses .
And these existed for tens of millions of years .
We were involved with several experiments .
The mycelium absorbs the oil .
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
They &apos;re very large .
Think of the implications .
as a treatment against consumption .
This is extremely rare fungus .
10 or greater are considered to be very active .
And so , for the first time , I am showing this .
They gave it to the queen .
This has huge implications .
It covers over 200,000 species .
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .
Thank you very much .
But now what ?
So , thank you very much .
Well , now is that time .
Did I say that ? I guess I did .
And I &apos;m living proof .
Mars comes to mind .
And with knowing comes caring .
What about the water ? &quot;
That &apos;s bad news for the polar bears .
That &apos;s bad news for us too .
Also it &apos;s bad news for us .
But , there is good news .
There are still some blue whales .
There are still some krill in Antarctica .
How much ?
Thank you .
And he didn &apos;t speak Vietnamese .
And then onwards to Chau Doc .
She &apos;s here today with us in the audience .
Thank you mother .
This is Hermann Goering .
But he didn &apos;t confess to treason .
Now nobody believed him .
And he said , &quot; I &apos;ll prove it .
And then the charges of treason were dropped .
And he killed himself soon afterwards .
It wasn &apos;t just him who was in for a shock .
Why does this matter ?
Well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
So take food .
Would you eat this ?
That &apos;s not so surprising .
So one demonstration of this was done with young children .
Or take sex .
They just don &apos;t like it .
And here &apos;s a brief clip of this .
Not bad . It &apos;s also not good .
So she &apos;s struck with pity .
The third drops , the fourth , the fifth .
The pain gets less .
This was in the late &apos; 80s .
They wouldn &apos;t have me .
Here &apos;s me singing &quot; Sleep . &quot;
And I sent out this call to singers .
And then as the videos started to come in ...
He scrubbed the audio .
He made sure that everything lined up .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
So there &apos;s more . There &apos;s more .
Thank you so much .
And some younger members .
This is Beau Awtin .
Thank you .
Me too .
It doesn &apos;t matter the technology .
It wasn &apos;t a virtual choir .
This will be a premiere today .
Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you .
The emergency generators did not start .
The first time it was a C-section .
He &apos;s crying . He &apos;s screaming . He &apos;s praying .
Start all over again .
They were a pervasive presence .
I got lucky .
I learned something about courage .
It was a breath of fresh air .
It matters a great deal .
It was brilliant .
I became a parent .
This is wrong .
So this is what I &apos;m doing now .
And he signs off , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
I am thinking now .
It &apos;s an incredible opportunity .
They have the same architecture .
Fears also have suspense .
That &apos;s one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear .
Thank you .
A cheery thought .
This is the world we live in .
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea .
Thank you .
That &apos;s a lot .
It &apos;s then harvested .
There are different types of waste .
Front and back .
So let me run you through a few ideas .
Floor : sustainable , recyclable .
And that &apos;s a plastic polymer .
This is the waste room .
I compost it in this garden .
So , water is a very important aspect .
It literally is Waterhouse .
So you &apos;ve got to watch your space for that .
The People &apos;s Supermarket .
Really important .
That &apos;s zero food waste .
And no one &apos;s doing that just yet .
I &apos;m going to get there before you .
I think it &apos;s important .
Thank you very much .
It means greedy .
So take a look around this auditorium today .
I &apos;ll begin in 1824 .
I want to repeat that part .
We had plans .
1887 : The Dawes Act .
They were tired of treaties .
They were tired of sacred hills .
They were tired of ghost dances .
So they brought out their cannons .
Fast-forward .
They &apos;re killing each other .
So where does that leave us ?
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark ?
Give back the Black Hills .
Because , after all , God is just .
We actually have to do something about it .
What does this compassion entail ?
I call that unity God .
And they say &quot; It &apos;s 18 minutes . &quot;
Then he went home .
The cleaner came into the synagogue .
Ah , what a wonderful smell . &quot;
Takes the bread and goes home .
This went on for years .
Take the bread . Take it home .
And the rich man -- oh , dear -- crestfallen .
Henry Evans : Hello .
My dad was a lawyer .
I am lucky to have her .
I opened my refrigerator on my own .
I began doing tasks around the house .
All right , big finish .
Back to you , Henry .
HE : Thank you , Chad .
Actually , that &apos;s not true .
I would have died .
Thank you .
And this seemed very interesting to me .
And that hasn &apos;t changed at all .
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration .
He can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s hungry or tired .
It &apos;s not very challenging any more .
Thank you .
It was about shadows .
I wasn &apos;t quite sure what I was looking at .
It was about space and light .
Thank you .
Some chose the pen .
Others work through the instrument of money .
Thanks .
I chose this instrument .
I chose the gun .
It may even feel scary .
The Netherlands is not at war .
They are oppressed .
The Nazis invaded The Netherlands .
It was our last resort .
He fired again .
He could have done something .
They liberated my birth town .
I do not like guns .
Why ?
Why has violence decreased ?
Has the human mind changed ?
Or is there something else ?
It enhances peace even further .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s talk about billions .
Let &apos;s talk about billions .
So why ?
Everybody did empire .
This is not a new question .
That &apos;s a great question .
It &apos;s not geography .
It &apos;s the institutions .
You bet .
That is so right and so cool .
It &apos;s the same with institutions .
One , competition .
Two , the scientific revolution .
Three , property rights .
Four , modern medicine .
Five , the consumer society .
And six , the work ethic .
Think of what that means .
You just have to feed me . &quot;
Finally , the work ethic .
He was wrong .
Who &apos;s got the work ethic now ?
and Albania and Tunisia .
You &apos;re wrong .
Why ?
It &apos;s open source .
Warning : that may not work .
That &apos;s so true .
That &apos;s not the way history works .
Thanks very much .
What &apos;s your view on that ?
That tells you something really important .
Mostly they &apos;re worried about each other .
I &apos;m not at all a cook .
I have two loaves of bread here .
Who prefers the whole-meal bread ?
And life is really , too .
Why do we have this image ?
So what is happening ?
We added in more sugar .
But this is a fallacy .
So what can we do ?
And I &apos;m making a real plea here .
So what can we do ?
That &apos;s where we should move .
That is not necessary .
It has different functions .
Talk to people in restaurants .
Take some of my bread .
Have some of it .
We &apos;ve never had that before .
So enjoy your bread .
Eat it , and feel privileged .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
They don &apos;t really go to the usual place that memories go .
Like , just , go out , and , you know , do your best .
But you &apos;re alive . That &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
Thank you .
So the question is , why is that ?
Just see the contrast .
But one time it broke down .
So I had another unproductive day .
That you see , the horizontal axis is where you place your country .
But how would you specialize ?
And that leads to specialization .
That leads to productivity .
Poor people apparently don &apos;t have the power to buy .
The car pays for itself .
because there were -- there were people who had computers .
They had modems .
And they had these branches .
So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank .
She typically buys a cow . The cow gives milk .
You can see it &apos;s pretty much covered .
This is what some people think .
&quot; Poor people are recipients . &quot;
Poor people are a resource .
&quot; Services cost too much for the poor . &quot;
I &apos;ve been very surprised .
&quot; Poor countries need aid . &quot;
It &apos;s just an experiment .
Thank you .
How does this happen ?
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
Now , why does this happen ?
Now , what &apos;s really going on ?
I talked about that earlier .
Your heart starts beating faster .
This can &apos;t be my mother .
How do you test this ?
You look just like my mother . &quot; OK ?
The patient &apos;s not delusional .
It sounds like an oxymoron .
Patients become depressed .
Some of them are driven to suicide , OK ?
Why does this happen ?
But that costs millions of dollars .
He had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
And my pain is being relieved . &quot; OK ?
And then I said , &quot; Close your eyes . &quot;
He closes his eyes .
&quot; OK , open your eyes . &quot;
&quot; Oh my God , oh my God , it &apos;s moving again ! &quot;
I said , &quot; What ? &quot;
He said , &quot; It &apos;s gone . &quot;
I said , &quot; What &apos;s gone ? &quot;
It &apos;s disappeared . &quot;
So , that &apos;s the bonus .
Why does this happen ?
Why does this happen ?
Why would that be ?
I &apos;m going to answer that question .
It &apos;s never been answered before .
Well , there are many theories .
That gives you the clue .
So far , so good .
Here , you &apos;ve got Martian alphabet .
Well , it &apos;s one or two mutants .
Ninety-nine percent of you .
You have to measure its specific gravity , OK ? &quot;
Thank you .
Sorry about that .
George Ayittey : Africa &apos;s cheetahs versus hippos
I call them the Cheetah Generation .
They don &apos;t understand .
It &apos;s like the blind leading the clueless .
There are certain things that we need to recognize .
Africa &apos;s begging-bowl leaks .
It &apos;s taken out of Africa .
That &apos;s what the World Bank says .
Look at Africa &apos;s begging-bowl .
It leaks horribly .
What are the leakages ?
Yes , put that aside .
Put that aside .
Let &apos;s take food imports .
Not anymore .
I let that pass .
Government is the problem in Africa .
Where do they get their money ?
By creating wealth ?
No .
It &apos;s the seat of government .
It &apos;s dysfunctional .
First one is the political system .
It is a total far cry .
It &apos;s owned by extended families .
The accent is on the &quot; I. &quot;
Nonsense .
What do we do now ?
Could you please show that ?
There is also traditional medicine .
Thank you very much .
I look at even my family .
I stole essays . I cheated on exams .
I sold newspapers .
And he said , &quot; I know . &quot;
I did comic book arbitrage .
So that &apos;s obvious , right .
and making money off that too .
And I had these little pillows that I would sew up .
And you could stuff pins in them .
You can &apos;t do it on stage .
And I think I was 14 .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s a what ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a Bacchanal by Titian . &quot;
He said , &quot; It &apos;s a what ? &quot;
He said , &quot; You boneless bookworm !
How is it used ?
And you can just imagine them .
That was an interesting case .
You know it &apos;s an orgy .
Thank you .
And that &apos;s Richard Feynman .
&quot; Queerer than we can suppose . &quot;
Middle World .
Thank you very much .
They were part of the bad guys .
Think about this for a second .
Thank you .
And I wrote a couple of chapters .
First of all , I enjoyed writing .
Which I think is just fascinating .
So think about these two tables .
And you must have seen this illusion .
Which one seems longer ?
I can animate the lines .
Brown . Thank you .
The bottom one ? Yellow .
Very very hard .
Or maybe it is about religion .
And here is the story .
And what happens ?
I &apos;ll give you one more example for this .
So you refer the patient to hip replacement therapy .
Hip replacement . Okay ? &quot;
What happens now ?
Imagine I give you a choice .
Or a weekend in Paris ?
I said , &quot; What would you choose ? &quot;
And as a consequence , people chose it .
One more example of this .
The answer was absolutely yes .
Now you &apos;re getting it .
Thank you very much .
And it &apos;s the process of learning things .
And that was the mythology of skill .
Excuse me .
And juggling -- the balls cross and all that .
And then you get crazy .
OK ? Another way is the outside .
Same pattern .
Make it faster and smaller .
Make it wider .
Make it narrower .
Bring it back up .
OK . It &apos;s done . Thanks .
Green .
Yellow .
Pink .
White .
You want to do it ? Yeah ? OK .
What you &apos;re going to learn is this .
Index finger , middle finger , ring , little .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
A little bit faster .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . OK .
Shake your hands out .
OK ? Here we go .
Finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . Green .
Finger , finger , finger , finger . Yellow .
Pink , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
All right .
Ahhh .
So , a moment .
So , a moment .
Another moment .
Cheating .
To have a conversation with it . To speak . To listen .
Oh , let &apos;s see here .
I &apos;m going to do just a short version of it .
And then changing levels .
Let &apos;s see here .
And to change , and to change .
There &apos;s a definite difference .
She wasn &apos;t miserable at all .
He maintained a calm insouciance .
We can categorize it like that .
Sue wasn &apos;t trying to achieve difference in her life .
We &apos;d be pretty uncomfortable .
But that &apos;s not good enough .
This is the bar that he set for us .
That &apos;s the good news .
It &apos;s skin from his back .
What does that mean ?
But we &apos;ve still got problems .
We &apos;ve got mouth cancer to solve .
We need to do research .
Let &apos;s leave it as it is . &quot;
Thank you very much indeed .
which I made people make in the auditorium , was heard around the world .
So , let &apos;s roll the video .
How can you use this stuff ?
Here focusing in on Haiti .
Frank Gehry : A master architect asks , Now what ?
The wall was covered with ...
I had an explosion .
It &apos;s a big issue .
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head .
So where do we go now ?
FG : I don &apos;t really know .
FG : Yeah .
It was intuitive .
I just stopped .
Did you see that thing ?
RSW : No . What did he say ?
Audience : Liquid architecture .
FG : Liquid architecture .
Or is it going to be down near ...
FG : I don &apos;t know .
What &apos;s the schedule , Richard ?
FG : 2004 .
Blah , blah , blah and all that stuff .
I was so proud .
They came for three days .
FG : Yeah , the computer building .
People put buckets out ...
FG : Ask Miriam !
RSW : Didn &apos;t get a laugh .
and then what ?
What do you bring to it ?
RSW : Did it leak ?
FG : No .
And I &apos;ve met with some of these people .
So four of us went .
RSW : Oh , my God .
I said to my team , &quot; Let &apos;s get out of here . &quot;
We stood up , we walked out .
I said , &quot; Nope . &quot;
And we get a lot of that .
I don &apos;t have my own plane yet .
But let me just say a couple words .
FG : Can I say something ?
FG : No , no . Wait a minute !
Fantastic tales , anecdotes from speakers .
Go for it ! The worst .
Famine .
Corruption .
More .
Genocide .
AIDS .
Slavery .
That &apos;s enough .
This was 300 BC .
Fast forward to 2002 .
Let &apos;s start unpacking it .
What does the data say ?
So let &apos;s start on that .
So let &apos;s start looking at some of those .
It &apos;s meaningless .
The announcement just came out the last few weeks .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s going on in some of the other countries ?
Bakino Faso : B-minus . And so on .
Thank you .
That &apos;s probably true of humans as well , mostly .
This is amazing , I think .
Again -- this time , sycamore -- wind-dispersed .
Cool pollen , though .
This one I particularly like .
Isn &apos;t that cool ?
Where has it been ?
Well , this is about state budgets .
The understanding is very low .
But we have a problem .
Here &apos;s the overall picture .
Well what are we taking in ?
Simple business question .
Answer is 26 percent .
Well , some really nice little tricks .
It &apos;s got holes .
It perpetuates deficit spending .
They borrow money .
They sell off the assets .
They defer the payments .
They sell off the revenues from tobacco .
Well what &apos;s going to give ?
So what &apos;s going on ?
Just look at this spending .
Everybody has an opinion .
There &apos;s great feedback .
So what do we need to do ?
We need better tools .
It &apos;s the gold standard .
We just shot you . &quot;
Thank you .
You can only do them one at a time .
And then early one morning , at 6 a.m.
So with that , I would like to open it first to the floor for questions .
Yes , in the back .
We throw it away .
Any ideas who said that ?
Shakespeare &apos;s Julius Caesar .
We &apos;ve treated it as an enemy .
You don &apos;t eat . You don &apos;t drink .
And you don &apos;t have sex .
So let &apos;s move to the brain .
Now , here we have a brain .
Okay . So where have we got to ?
So why do we sleep ?
It &apos;s gone in and out of fashion .
It &apos;s really hugely attenuated .
It &apos;s simply not enough .
Well , my goodness gracious .
Ghrelin is released . It gets to the brain .
But stress is so much more .
So a quick show of hands .
Oh . Well , that &apos;s pretty impressive .
Well , it &apos;s not rocket science .
Listen to them . Listen to yourself .
What do you do ?
So seek out morning light .
Simple as that .
So what &apos;s going on ?
So what &apos;s going on ?
And what &apos;s the evidence for that ?
Other work flowed from these studies .
So what have we got ?
So let me just finish .
And this isn &apos;t some sort of crystal-waving nonsense .
Thank you for your attention .
I ran up to him and said , &quot; Bill !
Oh , life can be so cruel .
Don &apos;t touch my hair , that &apos;s the thing .
He led them to America .
And they said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Harvard was wrong , big time .
Well , our gaze fills the universe .
Thank you .
Curtis Wong : Thank you , Roy .
So we &apos;ll see you there . Thank you .
Big questions .
Let &apos;s take it on a maiden voyage .
More on that later .
This is the agriculture .
And so we were working to sequester carbon .
We were growing plants like crazy .
And we had sleep apnea at night .
Not me , that was for sure .
And we did indeed find it .
Essentially it had done something very simple .
Pretty straightforward really .
People stink !
People must have thought I was nuts .
It was really quite astonishing .
It is so dry .
This is what I saw .
But this is also what I saw .
In this case it was oilseed .
So they &apos;re all shitting each other &apos;s ponds , quite literally .
Kyoto Protocol system .
It &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
It &apos;s a certain type of aesthetic .
We &apos;re very uncomfortable with untidiness .
I &apos;ve been building topsoil .
And I have an oasis .
The small stuff counts .
The yogis had it right .
Take a breath now .
Thank you .
We &apos;ll start here .
Okay ?
Here is how big of a crater was left .
Why is that important ?
That would be bad .
To give you a sense of scale , this is about a mile wide .
This did a huge amount of damage .
They &apos;re just not big enough .
what can we do about this ? All right ?
This is a potential threat .
Well , what do we do about them ?
It &apos;s right here .
But you can see that it &apos;s extremely faint .
These things are faint .
Right ? Move . The car goes past you .
However , think about this .
Well , my opinion is , fine . Okay ?
And this is the part , it &apos;s the part I just love .
Instead you get near it .
So think about this , right ?
So ...
This happened to them .
Thank you very much .
I drink coffee .
You might be gay .
It goes and goes and engulfs !
It &apos;s really quite silly , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s wonderful .
What do they want ? &quot;
The gay agenda , people !
There it is !
I &apos;m looking at you , North Carolina .
But you &apos;re not looking at the U.S. Constitution .
He has a 4.0 .
He volunteers .
He prays before he eats .
Look to your right .
Thank you .
It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
Do you see ?
Isn &apos;t it amazing ?
Poignant .
This was a Mother &apos;s Day gift .
Particularly creepy .
This is project called Ray .
And this is what came to me .
Here &apos;s how the song goes .
All right . Stay strong . Peace .
It &apos;s actually in the key of B flat .
One stood out in particular .
That song -- Thank you .
I heard you were looking for me . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Yeah , Ray .
It &apos;s been an interesting two weeks . &quot;
And it makes me think of this .
This is Pain Pack .
Recording : Okay , here &apos;s something .
I &apos;m not alone , and I am loved .
I &apos;m really fortunate .
You can look at it online .
So I thought , &quot; Well let &apos;s just give it a try .
Some came from the winning party .
It &apos;s amazing .
And this was &quot; Scared . &quot;
And I don &apos;t have much time .
I was like , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
Didn &apos;t know I had one . &quot;
And so what I decided to do .
And this is the kind of thing that I got back .
We call it the Water Canary .
Thank you .
I am not a Luddite .
I teach at Stanford .
The woman says , &quot; Good Morning . &quot;
She says , &quot; It was good . &quot;
She says , &quot; I did . &quot;
And she says , &quot; I am . &quot;
You notice the clay on the soles of her feet .
He made no attempt at diagnosis .
I call it the iPatient .
Who &apos;s in charge ?
The focus was around the patient .
And she found the place and decided to go there , went there .
And she was reluctant to tell me .
They had her scanned inside out .
But to her , it mattered deeply .
I was very influenced by that anecdote .
This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy .
There was just no way .
And I began my ritual .
This is real .
We signal the passage of a life with rituals .
Rituals are terribly important .
They &apos;re all about transformation .
I would pull down the eyelids .
I would look at the tongue .
I would percuss the chest . I would listen to the heart .
I would feel the abdomen .
And then the next day , I would come , and I would do it again .
It was an offering , an invitation .
I did not decline .
I will see you through this .
I will never abandon you .
I will be with you through the end . &quot;
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m just going to play a brief video clip .
So , I decided to embark on a quest .
This was the first one .
And it arrived , and it was tiny .
And I was outraged .
It was like , 160 dollars for this ?
I almost couldn &apos;t finish it .
White truffles .
One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world .
It &apos;s not in their taste , really . It &apos;s not in their texture .
It &apos;s in the smell .
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
Yeah .
They did give me a tour , though .
It has 360-degree views .
It has four balconies .
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver .
That said , a lot of work goes into these .
But no compliments .
Thank you .
It was very green , it was very peppery .
Oh , yeah , you know this one ?
That &apos;s right .
There &apos;s one with a fragrance dispenser .
The seat is preheated .
There &apos;s an air jet that dries you .
You get up , it flushes by itself .
And I want to get one of these .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s that bad of a deal .
This was a fun one .
And it was really amazing .
It was such a smooth ride .
But it &apos;s 60 years old .
There &apos;s not much of it left .
And it was an invitation you do not refuse .
I went .
It was three days , four meals .
There were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic .
There were some people who were a little less impressed .
And it wasn &apos;t just to that wine .
Thank you .
And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , actually . &quot;
And I left .
They &apos;d say , &quot; This is very boring . &quot;
And indeed they had .
I called in 26 children .
They said , &quot; Yes , we did . &quot;
They said , &quot; We look at it every day . &quot;
And then that &apos;s her over there .
Whatever the expression , it was not very nice .
But 30 percent is not a pass .
She said , &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot;
I made them into groups of four .
&quot; You can exchange groups .
I &apos;ll come back after two months .
The granny cloud sits over there .
Teacher : You can &apos;t catch me .
You say it .
You can &apos;t catch me .
Children : You can &apos;t catch me .
Teacher : I &apos;m the gingerbread man .
Children : I &apos;m the gingerbread man .
Teacher : Well done . Very good ...
It &apos;s pretty simple stuff .
I went to Turin in May .
I said , &quot; Well , do it . &quot;
This sent shivers up my spine .
We could change everything .
Thanks .
How about that ?
That &apos;s the original . &#91; Unclear &#93; That &apos;s the two together .
Ultimately , I started with the experience .
That &apos;s where I &apos;m at .
The transition will be this one .
But yet , it was human .
And I want you to hear that right now .
And fortunately , it &apos;s right in here .
It &apos;s one minute long .
Seriously , but dangerously fun .
A play ballet .
This is a mountain goat .
Rough and tumble play .
Imaginative play .
Well , a lot .
So what happens ?
They both hide out .
And we all have capacity to play signal .
And you can trust it .
That &apos;s a shame .
And therefore , the most playful .
And so he followed up on it .
This is our maiden voyage in this .
The Wearable Meeting .
Thank You .
There &apos;s no other cause .
Where had that water gone ?
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere .
One good thing did come out of it .
Why has it accelerated lately ?
We had no understanding of that .
What are we going to do ?
So let &apos;s do that .
Let &apos;s look at some results .
It &apos;s fine .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you , Chris .
I &apos;m just going to ask you one quick question .
How do you start ?
And this is my profile .
I have navigated to a total of four .
The red dots have exploded .
The gray dots have grown exponentially .
And why is this happening ?
This is happening today .
We are being watched .
Thank you .
And some days , that can even be a little scary .
Just like today .
So we got to work .
And I like that kind of response .
And we succeeded .
You can watch them any time you want .
It &apos;s a really exciting time .
&quot; The Better Man . &quot;
I was the better at getting and keeping .
Who was the better man ?
Who was the better man ?
Who was the better man ?
Let me try and describe her to you .
White , platinum hair .
Bright as a button . All the ducks in a row .
&quot; Never Go Back . &quot;
Never go back . Never go back .
Never return to the haunts of your youth .
Never go back . Never go back .
Never go back . Never go back .
Ladies , don &apos;t do it .
Don &apos;t do it .
Stop it .
Tell them to go to hell .
Just leave them alone .
Lady lady , do not weep .
Turn your pillow . Dry your tears .
Count thy sheep and not thy years .
Nothing good can come of this .
Nip and tuck till crack of doom .
Nor may time be bought or sold .
Do I shrink from thy caress ?
Never was there one so fair !
America is an empire .
Let me put this bluntly .
&quot; Hail to the Gods of America . &quot;
Hail to the Gods of America !
Hail to the gods of the dream .
Invictus E Pluribus Unum .
Which is America &apos;s Jupiter ?
The Brahmins of Capital Hill ?
They eye of a dollar bill ?
Or is it celebrity status ?
The worship of those we hate .
What of the titans of media ?
Or Hollywood &apos;s siren call ?
What of the Brand and the Label ?
What of the upstart Sport ?
Aye , that it does .
&quot; Love Came to Visit Me . &quot;
At 20 the torch of resentment was lit .
Okay , I was ill .
I &apos;m not an evil man .
Not with much success .
But human nature doesn &apos;t change , mate .
Oh , we did .
We hunted them down wherever they were .
Rivals for meat . Rivals for berries .
And they never will .
And I am as bad as you .
It was like Dante &apos;s &quot; Inferno . &quot;
It was unbelievable .
It was absolutely unbelievable .
Twenty-two godchildren I &apos;ve got .
What do I say to them ?
&quot; Our Lady in White . &quot;
Pale she was , listless ; And soft to the touch .
And there on the table we took her , in turns .
Many there were , to covet her kiss .
But only just .
It struck her as strange .
He &apos;d been a miner .
She thought about her town .
Vermiculite was in the playground .
It was in the football ground .
It was in the skating rink .
But she was really amazed .
It &apos;s lined with vermiculite . &quot;
This wasn &apos;t ignorance .
It was willful blindness .
You have chosen not to know .
Eighty-five percent . That &apos;s a lot of silence .
It &apos;s a lot of blindness .
Nothing &apos;s ever going to change .
Better not to see this stuff at all .
They are crushed .
I think of Joe Darby .
She &apos;s like you , and she &apos;s like me .
Thank you very much .
You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a stink .
But there &apos;s no agenda .
Meetings are important , right ?
And we &apos;re miserable .
Let me tell you why .
It &apos;s kind of funny .
Let &apos;s take a quick look .
Sound familiar ?
&quot; That was my day every day ! &quot;
&quot; This is my life . &quot;
It made me laugh until I cried .
It &apos;s right at our fingertips , literally .
It &apos;s something that I call ¡ No MAS !
It &apos;s right next to the accept button .
No MAS !
Thank you .
.
Nellie McKay : &quot; The Dog Song &quot;
Thank you .
You all know this story .
Think about it .
That &apos;s -- that &apos;s not true .
But it is strange .
And that &apos;s when it happened .
&quot; Oh , &quot; he said , &quot; little green men . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s no such thing . &quot;
I looked around .
The street was entirely empty .
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean .
It was as though time had stopped .
Slits for mouths ?
&quot; Kew , kew , kew -- watch out . &quot;
She was very tall , I would say .
And then it got stranger .
I did not even turn my head .
The movie began .
Please .
Except for the girl .
Does something seem strange about this to you ?
And to this day , I have no answer for you .
We went to some topless beaches .
Excuse me ? No , not in my life .
And did I want to come with ?
She was smiling .
Now , I did not speak Portuguese .
I did not know where the beach was .
And so I sat down to wait .
We are not alone .
Thank you for your kind attention .
&quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
&quot; She is going to the library . &quot;
&quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
I spent some time telling the college G.P.
You see that glass of water ?
Two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
Now at first , I would have believed them .
I &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot;
Strategic .
So it &apos;s not all bad .
We are unique . We are irreplaceable .
The light never goes out .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Hi , everybody .
Ban-gap-seum-ni-da .
Do you feel like you are all alone ?
Thank you .
It &apos;s such an honor for me .
But it &apos;s now your turn .
Play your life , and stay tuned .
And of course , &quot; rugged &quot; goes without saying .
And this is the big difference .
And boom , boom , boom . The president of Mongolia .
Thank you .
Now that &apos;s something I fall short of on a daily basis .
But that &apos;s not all .
Why did I say that ?
Well there are a lot of reasons for this .
We &apos;re becoming impatient .
We &apos;re becoming desensitized .
This is not trivial .
Would you like that ?
Good .
The first one is silence .
It &apos;s a waltz .
I love it .
Or just try this one on for size .
Wow !
I call that the hidden choir .
There are many .
Have fun with that . It &apos;s very exciting .
And finally , an acronym .
It &apos;s Monday morning .
This is no exaggeration .
The results were quite extraordinary .
It literally flat-lined .
But experts do get things wrong .
But how can we do this ?
What is the evidence upon which this is based ?
And what has it ignored ?
But we need to go even further .
Thank you .
But not always .
It &apos;s sort of cloudy water .
So , it &apos;s controlled .
Well , in Peru it didn &apos;t .
And the idea is very simple .
So , you get this vicious cycle .
They had dammed up the Tennessee River .
And these are the data .
It is the G8 Summit .
Africa has 53 nations .
Which country is that ?
Africa has received many opportunities .
Where has all the aid gone ?
The military , 380 billion .
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament .
I hope I have achieved that .
Thank you very much .
So first I started with the mind .
And this was an amazing year .
It was really a fascinating journey .
Not really .
Thank you for that reaction .
I got both of them .
So there was the topiary there .
And there &apos;s the sheep .
I had to put on sunscreen .
There was the washing of hands .
I had to do that properly .
Well yeah , I tried that .
So that was nice .
And it was successful overall .
And I finally have stabilized .
And it was done in Europe .
And just to give you one instance of this : food .
And it has made me a healthier person .
So that is it .
The book about it comes out in April .
That &apos;s my greatest hope .
So thank you very much .
Peter Reinhart : The art and craft of bread
I call it the flavor rule . Flavor rules .
It &apos;s just dough that is wet .
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch .
That &apos;s what enzymes are doing .
They become accessible to the yeast as food .
Okay , we &apos;re going to start with the first stage .
We have to develop the gluten .
But then , quickly through the next few stages .
That &apos;s called &quot; rounding . &quot;
And then , stage nine .
We call it &quot; proofing . &quot;
So we turn it into flour .
I &apos;d call that radical .
So , we &apos;ve got now this flour .
In stage one , we weigh it .
It &apos;s like clay .
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars .
Second transformation , dead brought back to life .
Thank you .
So here &apos;s a video .
The next work is Decoy .
So here is the first test scenario .
And here is a prototype .
It comes out of the idea of a window .
So it &apos;s really quite small .
Thank you .
And he scans across the ocean , and he looks at the sky .
That was it .
I hope it will be .
There are a few key points .
They define what the system is .
That &apos;s the system .
The second one is internal energy .
Volcanoes erupt .
It &apos;s immensely complex .
This is a system that &apos;s been around a very long time .
What do I mean by that ?
We must understand it .
Look at this complexity here .
This is only one variable .
This is very , very exciting .
We know little or nothing about it .
And it wasn &apos;t easy . It wasn &apos;t easy in those days .
And that &apos;s what we really need .
It &apos;s a new world .
And this is what the planet looks like .
This is what it looks like .
And the cables go really continent to continent .
And this is just the first of these .
Very powerful .
There is a number of robotic systems .
It &apos;s a full spectrum of tools .
This is what it actually looks like .
Very , very powerful .
And this is the magic one .
Here &apos;s an example .
And they fly into the erupting volcano .
It &apos;s going to be amazing .
Thank you .
He was a very religious man .
And that worked for a hundred years .
But that turns out not to be true .
And three times , the answer is no .
And his answer was very interesting .
Odd plus even gives you odd .
These are robust algorithms .
Thank you .
It was taken 18 years ago .
I was 19 years old at the time .
But , this is really just the tip of the iceberg .
The nitrogen has two problems .
It &apos;s nitrogen narcosis .
It makes you loopy .
The deeper you go , the loopier you get .
We needed more time .
There had to be a better way .
You need voting logic .
You also have three microprocessors .
I &apos;m going to take you on a deep dive .
It &apos;s kind of like skydiving in slow motion .
Look at those ...
Uh-oh ... uh-oh !
Diver 2 : Uh , silvertip sharks .
Diver 1 : Oh .
Diver 2 : Hoo !
That little guy is frisky !
There &apos;s a lot of other ways you can die .
And I &apos;m not making that stuff up .
But , it &apos;s much more than that .
That &apos;s half-a-million dollars per pound .
It &apos;s sort of like sobering up .
I think that &apos;s a new species . &quot;
Now , this one &apos;s pretty cool .
This is the second extraordinary photograph I &apos;m going to show you .
I thought that was an old one .
Thanks .
It was great .
It &apos;s really amazing .
I &apos;ve been in the audience .
Like , what have I got to say about all this ?
Which it isn &apos;t really , is it ?
It comes from popular culture .
That &apos;s very important .
This is important .
Story is powerful .
It makes perfect sense .
He &apos;s sniveling .
Shut him up . &quot;
Please stop ! &quot;
Please stop ! &quot;
It &apos;s one that says , &quot; Don &apos;t do this .
I really don &apos;t care anymore .
And this is the difficulty that I face .
Have I not myself been imprisoned ?
Have I not myself been beaten ? &quot;
Excuse me .
But this is a good thing .
It &apos;s never going to be easy .
There are no answers .
&quot; Here , &quot; Jimmy said .
&quot; Here is love , all of it . &quot;
Ka-doooom .
Rise and walk away like a panther . &quot;
Thank you .
Between music and medicine
Thank you very much .
Well , this is how I approached it . This is what I did .
And she said , I can do this .
Have you seen changes ?
PM : Wow , that &apos;s amazing .
Men only .
And you know what we found ?
2002 .
SS : A lot more leaning in .
PM : Thank you , Sheryl .
SS : Thank you .
I &apos;m just the messenger .
Thank you .
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase .
We had a little natural experiment .
They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Here &apos;s a guy from Canada .
So look at these two .
Perfectly nice thing to do .
Thank you .
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal .
My mother was claimed by the war .
My dreams are like torment .
My every moment .
Never give up . Never give in .
Left home at the age of seven .
I &apos;m on a fight , day and night .
Ah ! The children of Darfur .
Left home .
Don &apos;t even know the day I &apos;ll ever return .
My country is war-torn .
I was ready to eat .
Thank you .
I hated the people in the north .
But I had this question .
So what &apos;s happening here ?
I don &apos;t eat breakfast . No lunch .
The people are giving three dollars .
As a nation we have been crippled .
Invest in education .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m asking .
One of them happened to be me now .
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma ?
Audience : Yes !
Emmanuel Jal : All right .
Yeah ! I &apos;m gonna get crazy now .
And I was one of those people .
She was my childhood friend .
Now , I found the answer very quickly .
She also embraced violence .
They were constantly short of cash .
They were constantly searching for cash .
I &apos;ll give you an idea .
Naturally , nobody wanted to fund my research .
And there are three main stages .
So what is rogue economics ?
It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire .
It has happened with Industrial Revolution .
It is trillions , it &apos;s not billions .
No other country can do that .
And this is what people did .
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars .
Now , who do we have to blame ?
Now , something else happened .
The second position is : Actually take positions .
Take joint positions with your client .
You do not know what the end result is .
Well , that &apos;s exciting .
All they needed was labor .
And here is the fruition of that in actuality .
The third configuration is a little harder to understand .
Effectively you would have something like this .
The proscenium can fly .
Here it is in a flat floor configuration .
The theater has been going through its kind of paces .
Here it is in an end stage configuration .
It was very unusual .
Again , just a couple people are required .
I promise .
Et voila .
There it is at night .
Thank you .
The year is 1800 .
It &apos;s called a microscope .
Fast forward 200 years .
The problem lies with the microscope itself .
It starts with a single sheet of paper .
You pop this in .
Right there .
Here is a sheet of paper .
So that &apos;s where the lenses go .
There are some light sources .
There it is , and it survives .
Thank you .
It &apos;s wonderful .
So this one was taken around five .
Thank you .
OK .
All right , guys , are you there ?
I &apos;m live . All right . There we go .
So they &apos;re broadcasting this live .
No , no . The other way .
I don &apos;t want to see you guys yet .
OK , never mind .
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
Thank you all very much .
still exists back home .
WITNESS .
We didn &apos;t even have a telephone .
Please enjoy .
Thank you very much . I appreciate it .
And what does that mean ?
You glaze over with it .
There was no ice around .
And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea .
Here &apos;s me in my office .
But it &apos;s worth it .
This is a bowhead whale .
And so people love to form their opinions .
So this is that story .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
This is just the food chain unfolding .
They &apos;re also big .
And they &apos;re also curiously aggressive .
It &apos;s time for you to get in the water . &quot;
But he was right .
And you can &apos;t publish excuses . &quot;
I put my flippers on . I could barely part my lips .
But I just started to shoot these pictures .
This didn &apos;t work .
And so that didn &apos;t work .
This went on for four days .
And I &apos;m so passionate about it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thanks very much .
Thank you .
&quot; Don &apos;t talk to strangers . &quot;
Stick with the people you know .
Stick with people like you . &quot;
How appealing is that ?
Thank you .
Me only existed in the trying .
My body was often in the way .
It was a way of locating myself .
It was an ecstatic experience .
It had no limits . It was invincible .
I was greedy .
Then I went somewhere else .
Now I am swimming in it .
And gratefully , it didn &apos;t .
And I was honored .
And she said , &quot; It &apos;s for you .
And I said , &quot; But what &apos;s the water part ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Of course it is . &quot;
It was finally being in my body .
It was people who came with spells and rituals .
It was a million prayers .
It was energy , love and joy .
It was all these things .
It was all these things .
Everyone &apos;s upset .
But the pizza is delicious .
And we were shocked .
This is Scarlett .
Thank you .
It &apos;s long and it &apos;s complicated .
The toolbox exists .
Well , guess what . It does .
So , then what do you do ?
Thank you .
The interspecies internet ? An idea in progress
This is a dolphin that is self-aware .
This dolphin has self-awareness .
It &apos;s a young dolphin named Bayley .
They &apos;re emotional . They &apos;re aware .
We are not alone .
We are not alone in these abilities .
And these are real personalities .
Look at this body .
This was a custom-made touch-screen keyboard .
Now here &apos;s a little video .
They explored the keyboard . They played around with it .
They figured out how it worked .
They imitated on their own .
I want to hear a grooming song .
She &apos;d never sat at a keyboard before .
Nice triplets .
PG : She hit good .
And we were happy with ourselves .
So can you please go ahead ?
Please go ahead .
NG : Those are for you .
Okay , that &apos;s great , thank you .
VC : Thank you , Neil .
But it leads to what is coming next .
What happens after that ?
Well , let &apos;s see .
It &apos;s operating on the International Space Station .
I can hardly wait .
What &apos;s next ?
What &apos;s special about it ?
That &apos;s called a profit .
The Golf was totaled .
The plant also gets smaller .
The same for GPS .
Ours is on the demand side .
Things were going pretty well .
Now I was getting a little anxious .
So let me step back and set the stage a little bit .
The surgery was successful .
My son still had his dad .
My training had started .
It was a lot of hard work .
That was a little curious to me .
But also , the sense of smell .
A lot of the information is good .
But it &apos;s all good in the grand scheme of things .
What could I do ?
&quot; Would you like some help ? &quot;
It &apos;s a perfectly great city .
&quot; Bless you , man . &quot;
&quot; Go for it , brother . &quot;
&quot; God bless you . &quot;
Everybody &apos;s welcome .
It &apos;s too late then .
Blind people want to work too .
They want to earn a living .
So thank you .
I see it everywhere .
Yeah . &quot; Lingua this , Frankie . &quot;
Emily Levine : Richard . What did I say ?
It &apos;s the subject subjugating the object .
And well , yeah .
&quot; For sale : White trash compactor . &quot;
And so was humor .
He hung up on me !
But I like to cross boundaries .
It only takes two years to learn how to talk .
&quot; No , you take the prize .
And this is instead of contradiction .
I &apos;m not sure what it &apos;s called .
Huh ? Huh ? What ? Can &apos;t hear you . &quot;
I had no joke for that .
I love connections .
And didn &apos;t that feel good ?
I still have a way to go .
And the daughter doesn &apos;t want to say anything .
He has to have poise .
It &apos;s an actual thing .
He &apos;s always on the road .
And thank you for inviting me into it .
Thank you very much .
But I am angry .
It is absolutely possible .
It &apos;s not like a bottle of wine .
Right ?
It wasn &apos;t about the customers .
You plant them in the spring .
That &apos;s a longer story .
But we know this is critical .
Now , you take pre-kindergarten .
I actually like kids .
So here &apos;s the other thing .
You go on vacation .
You come back from vacation .
You don &apos;t look at it .
Why would you look at it ?
I need that data in September .
We have run out of time .
Thank you all very much . Thank you .
What are you talking about that you want to leave school ?
So we built something .
So this is the motor .
These are from remote control airplanes .
It &apos;s incredible just how light this thing is .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve got no plans . &quot;
I wasn &apos;t trying to be funny .
I thought about it for a nanosecond .
Today we &apos;re going to talk about prime numbers .
One is not prime .
Don &apos;t freak out .
It &apos;s over two billion .
It &apos;s an absolute brute .
It was the year I left university .
My skill is not in the mathematics .
We &apos;re not talking politics today .
We &apos;re not talking sport today .
Don &apos;t forget to subtract the one .
That &apos;s the way it goes .
You think that &apos;s cool .
This is the CubeStormer II .
That is the essence of being human .
Thank you .
Could we reinvent fire ?
They &apos;ve created our wealth .
But they &apos;re really quite distinct .
Let me say that again .
Well that &apos;s what &apos;s actually happened so far .
It &apos;s fallen by half .
Thank you .
Just an extraordinary , terrifying scene .
I could do nothing wrong .
It changed my life .
Mother went into a coma .
&quot; What is this ?
I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot;
It made me think .
&quot; What do you want to do in a village ?
&quot; Dig wells for five years ?
I went to this village for the first time .
I said , &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; You failed in your exam ? &quot;
I said , &quot; No . &quot;
&quot; What are you doing here ?
Why are you here ?
You have to work with your hands .
You have to have a dignity of labor .
Who is a professional ?
Not even worth it .
I was in a bit of a spot .
This is what it looks like today .
This is waterproofing the roof . &quot;
The prime minister is 12 years old .
Never seen Sweden .
He &apos;s my donor .
The attendance must not drop . &quot;
Went to Afghanistan .
Television ? No .
Telegraph ? No .
Telephone ? No .
Tell a woman .
So I took the husbands along .
Sign language .
You don &apos;t choose the written word .
You don &apos;t choose the spoken word .
You use sign language .
And they haven &apos;t collapsed .
He didn &apos;t know .
&quot; What &apos;s the story . &quot;
I said , &quot; I can &apos;t , Mr. President .
Went to this village .
I said , &quot; No , I want to take this woman . &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah , she is very beautiful . &quot;
That was his biggest fear .
Success story .
Look for solutions within .
They &apos;re all over the world .
Don &apos;t even worry .
Thank you .
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance .
This is the Ministry of Justice .
And they redid that building .
This is Africa . It &apos;s hot .
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun .
And see what his response is .
And you see him do it again .
And that &apos;s exactly what the beetles are doing here .
Can you spot the difference ?
So there he is there .
Shame .
It hasn &apos;t a clue .
Thank you .
Raise your hand if you do . Oh , wow .
You ask , why ?
Please , don &apos;t try this at home .
It &apos;s not bad .
I would have stopped to help . &quot;
And the answer is , yes we can .
His name is Matt Weiger .
That &apos;s a good thing to do , right ?
I don &apos;t really believe it is .
and more in other countries who do that .
Thank you .
Can &apos;t we make better stoves ?
But this device was very slow .
So you could imagine they were very excited about it .
So it was a little discouraging to the students .
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass .
And you can see that it &apos;s a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel .
And so we were very happy , thus far .
So we can pass these around .
They can generate income from this .
Thank you .
She loved life .
She no longer danced .
My grandmother had depression .
We are just not doing enough .
Let &apos;s start with heart disease .
This is the face of heart disease .
It showed no blockages .
Linda &apos;s symptoms continued .
She had to stop working .
But Linda was lucky .
We have the tools .
We have the technology to make the diagnosis .
So what about treatment ?
What a lost opportunity .
All three were nonsmokers .
Now , here are some clues .
That &apos;s her legacy .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t want to romanticize poverty .
Thank you .
Good afternoon .
I am not a farmer .
And this is my world .
They &apos;re getting sicker .
And that &apos;s really what this is all about .
This is my harvest , people .
Okay , I &apos;m going to tell you what it does .
Okay ? We &apos;re feeding seniors .
And that &apos;s just great .
And what does it really do ?
This is what we &apos;re doing .
And we &apos;re stepping it up .
This is a beautiful moment .
This has got to go tomorrow .
But most importantly , just love them .
We can do something here .
Sí se puede !
I was 28 years old .
Her mother was still alive .
Hyun-Sook was 11 years old .
Hyun-Sook was in fact the fifth child that I found to photograph .
This is on the way to school .
This is on the way home .
And that &apos;s North Korea up along the hill .
This is up along the DMZ .
Why is everyone crying ? &quot;
Did I know anything about this ?
And the house that I had spent time in was empty .
It was incredibly cold .
And I said to the translator , &quot; What did he say ? &quot;
I was very worried about her .
I kind of said , &quot; Oh God , now what ? &quot;
Gail couldn &apos;t come .
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire .
I remember a sort of a tussle at the door , trying to get the door open .
This guy &apos;s 60 years old .
Pledge of Allegiance for the first time .
This is her cooking teacher .
She &apos;s being baptized .
The captain of the cheerleaders .
Beauty pageant .
Gene is looking a little older .
And there &apos;s Evan .
I started crying .
Thank you all of you .
They grow 10 meters long .
Some say bigger .
They might weigh up to two tons .
Some say up to five tons .
They &apos;re fantastic creatures .
And we were very effective .
I &apos;ll show you what they look like .
These are archival tags .
Were there subpopulations ?
That &apos;s it .
I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t believe it .
And they actually did get a fine for that .
So that wasn &apos;t going to work .
So I scraped it off .
And so he was all very excited .
So we were desperate .
And here it is .
And we cogitated about this for about four years .
This is very , very low .
That &apos;s very practical and extremely awesome .
EL Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from .
What do they tell us ?
Let me give you an example .
And so I might say , &quot; Yesterday , I throve . &quot;
How to know ?
What should I do ? &quot;
For instance , this one .
So that &apos;s sort of what we expect .
It &apos;s kind of like genomics .
Culturomics is similar .
Why can everyone do it ?
So what happened is , of course , this is just a mistake .
Thank you very much .
Let me talk about my own experience .
It was even tax-deductible .
We had a longer-term time perspective .
We are , Germany , is not ratifying .
Thank you .
It &apos;s really cool .
They &apos;re pretty cool .
It does pretty good .
This is a clay maker .
I thought , this would be so great !
I loved dinosaurs .
That &apos;s David Letterman .
That &apos;s my youngest cousin .
Way ahead of my time here .
I love toys !
Most of them did not go .
But moving on .
So this is my family .
All right , there &apos;s that robot again .
Let &apos;s make these things .
And so I &apos;ve always had a big interest in this .
There &apos;s another one .
And that &apos;s my little workshop .
So she comes to the rescue .
And she does drawings , right ?
She &apos;s an actual , you know , artist .
That was a good one .
That &apos;s a juvenile .
Very , very obsessive .
So there &apos;s the motor .
And then , of course , you &apos;re not done yet .
Hey .
That &apos;s good , wake up , wake up , wake up .
There you go .
They do change over time .
Excuse me , Pleo .
This is John over here .
Thank you .
Of course , the cage was salvaged .
This is Uce .
No . No . No . Wrong .
It &apos;s not good .
And these are horrible images .
There was no agricultural productivity left .
We have 30 species of reptiles .
But we saw the same thing .
There are no trees left .
So how &apos;s this possible ?
So beautiful . What a theory .
January .
February .
March .
April .
May .
Fire is the biggest problem .
And this forest is quite different .
And they become like nutrient pumps .
165 .
Can you imagine ?
So this is after one year .
And this is after two years .
Rainfall is up .
And look at these images .
I &apos;ll just run them very quickly through .
This is how it looks .
I &apos;ve been blown away by the whole thing .
In fact , I &apos;m leaving .
Like religion , and money and other things .
Thank you . That was it , by the way .
Well , I was born ... no .
And the girl said , &quot; I &apos;m drawing a picture of God . &quot;
He was in the Nativity play .
They just switched , that was it .
So why is this ?
My son didn &apos;t want to come .
We all have bodies , don &apos;t we ? Did I miss a meeting ?
We know three things about intelligence .
Because you are , aren &apos;t you ?
It wasn &apos;t an available condition .
Take her to a dance school . &quot;
And he &apos;s right .
Yeah , you did .
Thank you for putting your hand up over there .
Just what is a hectocotylus ?
Mm-hm .
And quite frankly , that &apos;s exactly what it is .
Why do they do this ?
Mm-hm .
So thank you , and happy daydreaming .
It &apos;s kind of a well-kept secret .
This species lives only in the Congo .
It permeates their entire life .
And it &apos;s used for communication .
And it &apos;s used for conflict resolution .
We divided our world up with lots of categories .
They had no stone tools .
He doesn &apos;t stand quite as upright .
This is Kanzi .
He &apos;s a Bonobo .
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier .
And now we see all four .
None of them are tricks .
We have eight Bonobos .
Good .
We need more sticks , too .
That &apos;s a wasps &apos; nest .
You can get it out .
I hope I have a lighter .
You can use the lighter to start the fire .
You &apos;re happy .
You &apos;re very happy about this part .
Good job .
This is his sister .
Goodbye .
Very impressive .
She keeps staring out the window .
It &apos;s a geometric language .
What is she writing ?
Soon she began to write as well .
How did they develop ?
Researcher : Go ahead . Go ahead . I &apos;m listening .
Take the cherries too .
Now you can chase them again . Time to chase them .
Now you have to stay away . Get away .
Run away . Run .
Now we can chase them again . Go get them .
Oh no !
Thank you .
We already saw that briefly yesterday .
They are a graphical visualization of a character .
There &apos;s no real emergence there .
It &apos;s a very trivial thing .
Torsten Reil : That &apos;s it , yes .
So , it was back to the drawing board for us .
So we started the company .
Nothing really interesting , basically .
It falls over , but it falls over like a rag doll , basically .
It will realize autonomously that it &apos;s being pushed .
It &apos;s going to stick out its hands .
I &apos;ll show you this again .
And then , finally hits the floor .
That &apos;s something that you cannot do right now .
First , starting with a push from the right .
And now from the left -- and it falls differently .
I haven &apos;t shown this to anybody yet .
And this is what happens .
Now , here &apos;s another one .
You feel kind of sorry for the guy .
Yes , you can just about see it here .
So , this was not something we actually put in there .
He &apos;s actually a better dancer than I am , I have to say .
And I think -- there you go .
So it &apos;s just -- Thanks .
Thanks .
Thanks .
This time , it was different .
There were no coups .
Everything was different .
It had shattered into pieces .
The first is it made me fall in love with Africa .
Let me make it a bit more concrete .
You become the president of the United States .
You say , &quot; Let me try this way . &quot;
You might get impeached for that .
Well , you just can .
You decide you want to print money .
No , I don &apos;t think so .
Thank you .
It &apos;s great being here at TED .
It &apos;s like the canary in the coalmine .
I go , &quot; Why ? &quot;
&quot; Well , in order to reproduce . &quot;
&quot; Well , why ? &quot;
And that blew my mind .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
You &apos;re also talking about baseball .
And it &apos;s based on pizza .
So let &apos;s do this .
That &apos;s just not the way it happens .
That &apos;s usually a sign to the boy .
That &apos;s often given to the girl .
It &apos;s competitive .
We &apos;re playing against each other .
Everybody knows the rules .
&quot; Huh . I could go for some pizza . &quot;
You talk about it .
You talk about what you want .
You talk about what you like .
You may even negotiate it .
That doesn &apos;t work .
No .
Okay , but what about pizza ?
Well , in baseball , you play to win .
You score as many runs as you can .
But what about pizza ?
They &apos;re all exclamation points .
And who gets to answer those questions ?
You do . I do .
Thank you very much for your time .
We all love chocolate .
We buy it for our kids .
They &apos;re failed states .
We need a reality check .
But take the example of heparin .
It &apos;s a pharmaceutical product .
A no-brainer .
This is offshore .
And you can just look at the headlines .
Their voters are local .
They have parochial interests .
We need a different machine .
They don &apos;t own those facilities .
They &apos;re not legally liable .
We &apos;ll make it part of the contract . &quot;
That makes a difference .
Now , getting there is not easy .
It &apos;s crazy .
Multinationals are protecting human rights .
I know there &apos;s going to be disbelief .
Well , we don &apos;t .
So we audit .
Transparency is absolutely critical to this .
Go to the website . Look at the audit results .
Look at the health systems in so many countries .
No .
Absolutely .
It seems overwhelming .
They didn &apos;t say money .
So I appeal to you .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;d spoken to all the experts .
We &apos;ve got to pick you up . &quot;
I was a failure .
And of course , neither of these things happened .
And the expedition started in February last year .
And it &apos;s always drifting . The pack ice is always drifting .
: So it &apos;s day 22 .
I warmed the battery up in my armpit .
: Ninety .
It &apos;s a special feeling .
The -- the whole world underneath me .
I thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
: Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh .
What &apos;s next : Antarctica .
That &apos;s pretty much it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I had never seen an Internet .
But well , I &apos;m feeling good right now .
We have seven children in my family .
All sisters , excepting me .
The food passes through our bodies .
We drop down to nothing .
Because of the hunger , I was forced to drop out of school .
So I went to a library .
I couldn &apos;t read English that well .
It was one light at first .
I could not get rid of them .
I had never slept in a hotel .
God bless .
Whatever happens , don &apos;t give up .
Thank you .
It &apos;s like a water dowsing device .
Oh , sorry .
I want to believe , and you do too .
We believe all sorts of things .
It &apos;s more difficult .
Our second type of error is a false negative .
Your name is Lucy , okay ?
But no harm . You just move away .
You &apos;re more cautious . You &apos;re more vigilant .
You &apos;ve just won a Darwin award .
And so I think that we evolved ...
It &apos;s a horse head , that &apos;s right .
That &apos;s a pattern .
And is it really a horse ?
Or is it more like a frog ?
Yes , of course , it &apos;s a cow .
And what do you see here ?
Some people see a Dalmatian dog .
What do you see here ?
Planet Saturn . Yes , that &apos;s good .
How about here ?
Just shout out anything you see .
What do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?
Anybody see an object there ?
You think people are talking about you .
And we then call that schizophrenia .
And what pattern do you see here ?
These are sandals .
Because the lights on here .
And so your brain is fooled .
And you are correct .
Well , why is this happening ?
What &apos;s the difference between those ?
Some conspiracies really are true .
Explains a lot , maybe .
Because it worked .
You get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen .
It &apos;s just a minute and a half .
Go ahead and roll it .
Girl : No .
Girl : That would be fine .
So this is a blind test .
I &apos;m going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on .
Girl : Yes .
Girl : No .
Take a step here .
Okay .
And , Jennifer , how did that feel ?
Jennifer : Good .
Girl : Oh my God !
That &apos;s outside Antarctica .
Science is not arguing about that .
And several things are important .
That &apos;s the natural cycle .
But 280 is the peak .
Earth is having a fever .
But anyway , off to the world of ice .
That &apos;s the retreat of this glacier .
It &apos;s not static .
Geologic process in action here .
It &apos;s a long way .
On up to Iceland .
You can see it deflating .
So we wind time backwards now .
We go back a couple years in time .
That &apos;s where it started .
And on up to Greenland .
The interior of Greenland is to the right .
It &apos;s flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left .
We have a problem of perception .
I &apos;m certain that we can .
We stop for a drink of water .
I &apos;m going to be talking about this .
This is what it looks like now .
No comment .
We made a number of discoveries .
Thank you very much .
Just to give you an example of how it works in China , for example .
And you may wonder why .
And first it &apos;s quite simple .
My world was seen as less .
So you &apos;d just see her feet .
And all of a sudden ...
And then I saw her legs .
But I didn &apos;t get it .
Or do they need somewhere to live ? &quot;
And so they did .
It became part of me .
And I &apos;ll explain .
And I says , &quot; Well , try me . &quot;
Some of them were quite jagged .
So I did .
So I &apos;m thinking &quot; How can I do this ? &quot;
And it went like this ...
Gone .
And made the beams going around the house .
But I managed to do it .
And when I finished it , I came back the next day .
There &apos;s not enough room for the two of them .
I think he was just warning him actually .
Audience : No .
Then static electricity set in .
And it went ...
And I plucked the hair off the fly &apos;s head .
Decided to make a paintbrush .
And I looked at it underneath the microscope .
That was the paintbrush .
And it starts to dry very quickly .
So I have to be very quick .
So I have to be very very careful .
I would say it probably measures ...
a quarter of a millimeter .
And the horse is made from nylon .
And the spider &apos;s web is for the reins on the horse .
It must be a machine . &quot;
The most famous statue in the world .
And this is it .
So I broke the needle .
And that &apos;s how I managed to do it .
And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical .
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold .
As you can see , dressage .
And we were able to reconstruct it .
It &apos;s a dinosaur like no other .
And it is still true today .
Thank you .
I said , &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot;
I said , &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot;
They fall into the net .
Feeding time .
Because there is no boundary .
It &apos;s a natural process .
we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter .
The sand is 50 degrees .
I didn &apos;t put him in .
A classroom .
And a washbasin .
They talk to each other around the well .
Monkeys .
They tried to go in .
He hit his head .
He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
Just like sheep . &quot;
They need to get some injury .
Thank you very much .
One : Believe in overnight success .
And , voila ! I got in .
There &apos;s no time to settle down .
Yes , it may be hard to find talent .
Yes , the market may be bad .
Definitely .
Life is about the journey .
That &apos;s the best way .
Some steps will be right on .
Thank you .
Instead , it looks like this .
Not missiles , but microbes .
The second is the nature of the virus .
And that was just luck .
We should be concerned .
What are the key pieces ?
There &apos;s no need to panic .
Thank you .
Being a coward was a compliment .
My friends did not show up .
So that was my story .
Thank you .
Can I say one more thing ?
Thank you .
G &apos;day , my name &apos;s Kevin .
His name is Napoleon .
America comes second .
It &apos;ll affect so many things .
Well , there are two reasons for that .
Here &apos;s the first of them .
Here &apos;s the second reason .
That &apos;s my mom .
Any of you guys called &quot; Kevin &quot; ?
And so there was I.
I will improve it . &quot;
This guy up here ?
It &apos;s a core question .
Guess what ?
They were , in fact , given to Japan .
right around its periphery .
No real problems there .
What do I mean by that ?
These things are deliverable .
That &apos;s a terrible story .
I thank you .
KR : Thank you . Thank you , folks .
And then , I just got on with it .
And eventually , the work came in .
So it &apos;s just as well that I &apos;m a workaholic .
We live our lives forward .
Thank you very much .
They usually have obsessions .
SL : Yeah , it really is .
Did I meet your expectations ?
Most of them aren &apos;t .
Nobody comes to get famous .
I didn &apos;t see him get married .
DI : Now I walk in love .
So , the TED Prize .
How are we going to do that ? With this .
Those are the key ingredients .
That &apos;s the easy part , the technology .
This is the picture of us at that interview .
Now , no one has to wait anymore .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
Those are people that are going on an airplane .
That &apos;s a big airplane .
How hard can this be ?
It &apos;s all curled up .
What about these silly cats ?
Now you get my point .
They learn this through real-world experiences and examples .
and where the cat is .
Not so fast .
This is my son Leo .
Cars will run smarter and safer on the road .
First , we teach them to see .
Thank you .
Wish us luck .
Okay , just like the movies .
Light and oxygen work in different ways .
I &apos;ll come back to that .
It &apos;s not only transparent to light but it &apos;s permeable to oxygen .
It &apos;s got characteristics like a contact lens .
You don &apos;t see the surface structure .
There it is . That &apos;s great .
Thanks for listening .
Everybody , right ?
But here &apos;s where it gets tricky .
Now , I want to be clear here .
Well , that doesn &apos;t make sense .
Thank you .
I cannot forget them .
I cannot forget them .
Why were they there ?
What motivated them ?
So we were careful .
I was no more than just a commodity .
I was chained by a metal cable to my bed .
I could do only four small steps .
We are breaking my nerves very slowly .
How do you describe nothing ?
I don &apos;t play checkers anymore .
I begged for my food .
He would scream . He would beat me .
Ruslan was taken by surprise .
He talked to me about his children .
I talked to him about my daughters .
He did not touch me anymore .
He did not ask any other questions .
I was no longer just a commodity .
What could I possibly reply ?
He was young , he was shy .
I never saw his face .
He probably meant well .
One cannot assume this .
We have to .
We can &apos;t do otherwise .
It was a short meeting .
Why could he not understand this ?
We have a responsibility to try .
It &apos;s difficult .
So many broken lives .
This has changed .
Look at this picture .
This is unacceptable .
This is inexcusable .
Those crimes should not go unpunished .
Why them ?
Why am I here today ?
No easy answer .
I can count nine that I knew personally .
I &apos;ve lost that count .
Why do you do this sort of job ?
Thank you .
I have a confession to make .
I &apos;m an ethnographer .
The bottom line ?
How many of you recognize this man ?
Put your hands up .
How about these familiar faces ?
So think about it .
Some shots go through quickly .
They don &apos;t all go through in order .
Innovation is a journey .
They don &apos;t compromise .
They thought about it for a while .
Two groups coalesced .
Not on creating a vision .
Hire people who argue with you .
And , guess what ?
Thank you .
I know firsthand .
They &apos;re just normal people .
They politic with one another .
I have no wins .
So I asked him , &quot; You gonna hold it down ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t even respond .
That &apos;s what it was designed for .
Just a thought .
What &apos;s so fascinating up there ? &quot;
At that time , it was a plane passing by .
&quot; I don &apos;t know . You know ?
This is us . We are one .
Thank you .
Africa shall rise .
Thank you .
Sangu Delle : I think there is a role .
Very good . Thank you so much .
We are the number one champion in homicidal violence .
I certainly could not .
But we were dead wrong .
Lesson learned .
Thank you .
We have to really think .
And I believe there is .
This seems like common sense , right ?
We were a bit different .
So how do we go about doing something like this ?
It &apos;s actually a lot more than that .
Thank you .
This buzzing is a cicada .
This is a family of gibbons .
Well , we had people .
It looks super high tech .
We do have to protect them .
I was pretty nervous .
That guy &apos;s much braver than I am .
Thank you very much .
But that &apos;s not always the case .
This needs to change .
Thank you .
I have a giraffe here .
Sir , you caught the giraffe .
I have a playing card in my hand .
Audience member : 10 of hearts .
Sir , this is not your show .
Jesus .
Crazy people .
Something that would look like this .
We stop thinking too soon .
Now -- no , no , no .
Sturgeon may be correct .
Things can always change .
Sir , what was the card ?
The 10 of hearts ?
Secrets are important .
And secrets are valuable .
My answer was ...
Audience member 2 : The black card .
HG : Indeed !
It was a black card .
Audience member 2 : Spade .
HG : Indeed ! It was a spade .
He said , &quot; It could be a high spade or a low spade . &quot;
And my answer was ...
Audience member 2 : A high spade .
HG : Indeed ! It was a high spade .
And my answer was ...
Audience member 2 : The king .
HG : The king of spades , indeed .
Now sir , let &apos;s be fair .
Audience member 2 : King . HG : King of spades .
Audience member 2 : 17 .
HG : Indeed ! It was the 17 .
Nothing in the box .
The tension was building .
I really do .
Audience member 3 : I think so .
Let &apos;s make sure you have it .
Do you have it ?
Do you have it ? Perfect .
Is that fair ?
Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle .
You can shuffle cards like this .
Do you mind doing that for me , sir ?
Please cut and complete .
Up in the air .
And just like that .
I &apos;m going to try .
Is that your signature ?
Audience member 3 : Yes it is .
Audience member 4 : Seven .
HG : Seven .
Seven .
And after the nine ?
Audience member 4 : Two .
HG : The two . And after the two ?
Audience member 4 : Three .
HG : Three , and after ?
Audience member 4 : Three . HG : Three .
Audience member 4 : Seven . HG : Seven .
Audience member 4 : Four . HG : Four .
Audience member 4 : Two . HG : Two , and ?
Audience member 4 : Q.
The queen of clubs !
And that &apos;s my show .
Cancer ? Heart attacks ? Diabetes ?
Great .
Thank you . Thank you , sock model .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s very difficult to do .
So , come have your interviews .
And then , come back .
What do they need to know ?
And this is 25 years ago .
Don &apos;t tell us where you are .
Where do we start ?
Keep that to yourself .
You can &apos;t .
And that did two things .
Which is good .
So , we &apos;ve been busy .
It &apos;s what I &apos;d like to call my empty bucket list .
Thank you very much .
It &apos;s a quarterly report .
So this is the problem .
We put it out there .
There is no other question .
RS : Thank you so much .
So infectious diseases , right ?
Now of course , humans , we are creative . Right ?
We &apos;re not the only medical doctors .
Most famous , perhaps , chimpanzees .
They get sick like you . They get sick like me .
Very detrimental parasite .
They only eat milkweed as larvae .
And then I fed them to monarchs .
So my team and I started doing experiments .
And what we find when we do that is always the same .
They cannot prevent this .
They can also not medicate themselves .
Thank you so much .
And most people draw something like this .
The toast is then deposited for some time .
So it &apos;s crazy stuff .
That seems obvious .
It &apos;s too complex .
So what happens then ?
It &apos;s the essence of the design process .
So what happens then ?
Well , here &apos;s what happens .
So that &apos;s interesting .
Thank you .
That &apos;s the key thing .
There was some great response .
And then the situation deteriorated even further .
But there are similar stories from the other countries as well .
Thank you .
It wasn &apos;t all high tech .
Amazing .
Now , I believe so .
It &apos;s very powerful .
So what &apos;s the secret ?
Well , he told me .
I said , what has that got to do with anything ?
They have a point .
Thank you .
Hi .
I was born in Sierra Leone .
Don &apos;t rush to the door .
My grandfather had three wives .
Australia said , we will take you in .
In this bush , we found two huts .
We went to the bathroom to wash our hands .
Like , seriously .
We were very grateful .
It &apos;s this small place .
So fine , it &apos;s all good .
Let me say that . Chocolate color .
Type I is when they cut off the hood .
Oh my God .
&quot; You did something to me . &quot;
She &apos;s used to me mouthing off .
She said , &quot; Yes , I did .
I did it for your own good .
It was in your best interest .
I &apos;m like , &quot; How ? &quot;
Do you get itchy down there ? &quot;
I went back to school .
The naughty bits , you know ?
I don &apos;t have a clitoris .
That &apos;s what I want to know .
Didn &apos;t happen .
I want pleasure .
I want to get horny , dammit , as well . &quot;
She didn &apos;t get it .
It was celebrated .
It was all about the damn clitoris !
And I didn &apos;t have one !
That pissed me off .
I feel incomplete .
It &apos;s so that we don &apos;t have any sexual desire .
And I said , &quot; Am I asexual now ?
And there came then the big news .
Then I got married .
Sex was very painful .
It hurt all the time .
I am the lucky girl .
That &apos;s why it happened to me .
You heard me right .
And she said , &quot; Well , you married me . &quot;
FGM is child abuse .
It &apos;s violence against women .
That &apos;s what I have to say to that .
What are you going to do ?
Make it personal .
Thank you .
We reenacted this paper .
Let me tell you , it &apos;s very sudden .
Let &apos;s create a robotic vest .
You can see the commands .
And that &apos;s priceless .
Brain-actuating technology is here .
So this is the first demo .
He goes there and does it .
And they actually do .
Where is this going ?
We have no idea .
We &apos;re just scientists .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Technology will never absorb us .
It &apos;s simply impossible .
MN : Oh , tens of times .
So I &apos;ll start with mobility .
So this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier .
Thanks very much .
You don &apos;t believe me ?
Violence is migrating to the metropole .
Well , yeah , we should .
It &apos;s spiky .
Now take a look at New York .
What is their profile ?
Now , this is actually a good news story .
Take the case of law enforcement .
But it &apos;s not just the cops who are innovating .
Violence is going virtual .
We &apos;ve got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation .
And finally , there &apos;s technology .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s go south .
Where did this all begin ?
We &apos;re standing on it .
This is the power of Antarctica .
We had done it .
Our faces blistered out .
We had done it .
I became very low .
I was empty , lonely , financially destroyed .
And when -- I love my mum .
And it &apos;s not good news .
This is my son , Barney .
He is coming with me .
I &apos;m extremely proud of him .
Good on him , Barney .
We all own it .
We all have responsibility .
I know it &apos;s possible .
We are going to do it .
Good luck to you all .
Thank you very much .
That &apos;s a cool invention , literally .
Let me give you two examples .
Actually , no .
Let me give you an example .
How do they do that ?
They charge a flat annual maintenance fee of just 20 Euros .
and yet more effective .
Thank you very much .
That &apos;s the good news .
This is 2.7 million hectares .
So we cut this through the bank system and then linked this to the end users .
Now we start to see results .
So it &apos;s a good lesson for us .
But it &apos;s not even close to sufficient .
The goal is very clear .
There are several reasons for that .
I will not get into that now .
Two ways , two tons .
Same thing could happen in the energy sector .
Thank you .
So how do we do all that ?
It &apos;s a video I recorded about three years ago .
There &apos;s not too much we can see .
Here is a side-by-side comparison .
It &apos;s very simple to use .
So this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez85 .
It &apos;s kind of creepy .
But we didn &apos;t stop there .
So here are two examples .
So that &apos;s exactly what we did .
Again it &apos;s playing .
I call it the visual microphone .
That &apos;s one thousandth of a millimeter .
This is our team .
Thank you .
I &apos;m a lexicographer .
I make dictionaries .
It &apos;s a wug .
Now there is another one .
There are two ...
Audience : Wugs .
Nobody says this .
Who gets to wear a hat ?
What are the kinds of hats you get to wear ? &quot;
And I think that is , well , stupid .
The first way is the simplest way .
This is called compounding .
This is called functional shift .
And of course , you can &quot; green &quot; things .
Another way to make words in English is back-formation .
Why should you make words ?
And new words grab people &apos;s attention .
You can make a new word right now .
English has no age limit .
Thank you so much .
The power of yet .
There &apos;s hardly any activity .
They don &apos;t engage with it .
They engage deeply .
They engage deeply .
They process the error .
They learn from it and they correct it .
That has failed .
Don &apos;t do that anymore .
creates kids who are hardy and resilient .
And here are just a few examples .
Thank you .
Sometimes , it &apos;s almost creepy .
How did they do this ?
There are in fact quite a few errors .
Thank you .
Here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday .
So computers can also write .
So we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities .
Similarly , here , this neuron segmentation .
I want to give you an example .
So you get the idea here .
but where they &apos;re working together .
What are services ?
These are services .
What does that mean ?
Well , not really .
And we &apos;re here .
So what ?
Thank you .
It could have been Sean Bell .
It could have been Oscar Grant .
That part .
We &apos;ve been schooled in them as well .
Can you imagine that ?
Let me just start with number one .
We gotta get out of denial .
Stop trying to be good people .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Really ?
I know . Right .
The pilot is good .
Now , here &apos;s the problem .
That &apos;s my default .
Men are my default .
Who is your default ?
Who do you trust ?
Who are you afraid of ?
Who do you implicitly feel connected to ?
Who do you run away from ?
Don &apos;t even think about color blindness .
So here &apos;s the thing .
And she was like , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s interesting . &quot;
Who &apos;s in your circle ?
Who &apos;s missing ?
Because , you know what ? Just look around your periphery .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to blow this . &quot;
I mean , you just have to do it .
You start to say things like , &quot; Grandma &apos;s a bigot . &quot;
The children are at the table .
Thank you .
Did you know this was happening ?
Mike hasn &apos;t done anything wrong .
The uses and abuses of this technology aren &apos;t limited to the United States .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Where do you get your ideas ?
In the lunchroom .
&quot; Oh , &quot; we said , &quot; full length . &quot;
And back and forth .
Then a new tunnel .
What would it look like ?
They made all the stories .
He was supposed to be in the school at 8 a.m.
How did we do this ?
This is one of them .
And with some very creative solutions .
Narrator &#91; in Norwegian &#93; : Run it up and down .
Eight wires keep the camera stable .
He &apos;s doing fine . Everything went well .
Thank you .
You don &apos;t plan what &apos;s going to happen .
You have to just take your cameras with you .
It &apos;s like a sports event .
You rig them and you see what &apos;s happening .
And where is that cow going ?
That &apos;s Slow TV .
Thank you .
What I was witnessing was not only news , but also history .
with ordinary lives from ordinary towns .
Many were killed in a very short space of time .
The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue .
The following day , President Yanukovych fled Ukraine .
I hadn &apos;t heard that before .
Men fight most wars and women mourn them .
Glory to heroes . &quot;
Thank you .
But we have a few problems .
Demobilize .
I want to tell you one of these stories .
And he did .
The only thing that was in his mind was to see her .
They did meet .
Thank you .
We &apos;d love to help .
Thank you .
Now , what about labor demand ?
That &apos;s where it gets tricky .
We didn &apos;t want to forecast the future .
Highly speculative .
We did something else .
But where ?
A long answer would go like this .
Let &apos;s take Germany again .
That was 1998 .
Yes and no .
So what does this mean ?
So , what are they looking for ?
The top four topics are all around culture .
People are looking for recognition .
Thank you .
She feels different .
Nobody is allowed to film in these meetings .
You risk your life if you do .
Nothing can stop us from doing what we want .
The youth can beat you .
Some have lost their homes .
I didn &apos;t like what I saw .
The Palestinians refused .
Let &apos;s see what happened .
He will be arrested in a second .
We tried to understand how we can help .
You can buy them off the shelf .
I want to give you one example .
Grabbed ?
Violated by this conductor again ?
OY : Today , there is a new front in the fight for human rights .
Now , I am carrying this .
This is a much more powerful and much , much more effective weapon .
But we have to use its power wisely .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Pico Iyer : The art of stillness
It &apos;s an old idea .
Thank you .
Ready ?
Okay . What did you see ?
Maybe you saw discomfort .
I &apos;m going to give you just a few .
So how is that possible ?
And does that even matter ?
So why ?
So what did we find ?
But so too can our mind .
Yes .
It did .
No , it doesn &apos;t mean that at all .
Thank you .
But I love to talk .
They know .
It &apos;s like I &apos;m walking in two worlds most of the time .
But if you think about it , what is normal ?
What does it mean ?
It &apos;s &quot; you &apos;re amazing . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Well , good afternoon .
Woo hoo !
Oh , Pete .
I said , &quot; Sure , we &apos;ll come in . &quot;
ALS ?
We were the worst culprits .
And that was it . We were given our directive .
It means so very much to us . &quot;
Pete was put on a compassionate use drug .
He can &apos;t hold his head up any longer .
He can no longer swallow or eat .
He has a feeding tube .
He can &apos;t speak .
And that was on July 27th .
So week one , Boston media .
Week two , national media .
Did anyone see &quot; Lost In Translation &quot; ?
It was interesting .
Who &apos;s seen that one ?
It &apos;s absolutely fantastic .
J.T. , Justin Timberlake .
Incredible .
All of them .
It was unbelievable .
Well , guess what ?
It was on a three-year track for funding .
Two months .
It &apos;s coming out starting in two months .
All she said was , &quot; Jaw-dropping . &quot;
Bill Gates .
Goal number one , check .
Thank you .
What a gift .
Be passionate .
Be genuine .
Be hardworking .
And don &apos;t forget to be great .
Thank you .
This is important to create this exchange .
What kind of problems are you going to study ? &quot;
They &apos;re going to think about it differently .
Why you will record ?
What &apos;s the point of that ?
Where do we go with it ?
Maybe a few more extracts now .
Why do we record ?
I was still there .
Muito obrigado .
Vincent , Vincent , Vincent .
You don &apos;t do much editing .
It &apos;s correct ?
Tell us a couple of things .
VM : I &apos;ll just make it very short .
My email got hacked .
The head doctor , though , said no .
You don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
And so what do we do ?
What did they find ?
Incentives matter .
Then , we go one step further .
Here are a few .
I have loans and mortgages .
Well , two pieces of good news .
What a crazy new idea , right ?
I know this firsthand .
I knew my mother so well .
This is me . Now tell me about you .
We &apos;re in this together . &quot;
Thank you .
and Al Capone , times 50 .
But here &apos;s the good news .
First , don &apos;t do drugs .
Second , don &apos;t do drugs .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
That was a powerful talk .
What do you say to them ?
What are you doing right ? &quot;
And you &apos;re absolutely right .
It &apos;s dry as a bone .
They didn &apos;t have data and statistics .
It &apos;s in the introductory chapter .
It ignores the environment .
Do I have enough to eat ?
Can I read and write ?
Am I safe ?
Do I have rights ?
Okay , I &apos;m going to show you .
I &apos;m going to show you on this chart .
Higher is better .
Further to the right is more .
Or maybe the year after .
It &apos;s a good point , well made .
There we go . Lots of dots .
Come on , cheer !
Go , Brazil !
But that is only half a plan .
Thank you .
That small scratch became infected .
This was a miracle .
This is serious .
It &apos;s a fairly cheap drug .
But there are challenges here .
Viruses are becoming resistant .
Agricultural pests . Malaria parasites .
Mosquitos develop resistance .
So those are also resistant .
Thank you .
They said , &quot; What did you do ?
We said , &quot; Uh , it &apos;s art .
So we immediately said yes .
How many square meters is that ?
Row houses , 60 families .
So what did we do ?
This is our last project in Chile .
It &apos;s not about technology .
Vote for Constitución .
Participate !
Fisherman : I am a fisherman .
Twenty-five fishermen work for me .
Done well , of course .
You ! You are imposing this on me !
what is the right question .
It is life itself .
Thank you so much .
This is Leblon .
Bia &apos;s school stayed in place .
There &apos;s also Jovita .
Obrigado . Thank you .
And you wouldn &apos;t know it by looking at him .
Okay , that &apos;s pretty respectable .
I see people nodding .
Thirty-five million .
It &apos;s remarkable .
So this is me when I was 12 years old .
I &apos;ll give you one example of a fax campaign that I ran .
What about the values ?
So the first is Apple .
I would argue no .
It &apos;s extraordinary .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
One is piloting .
There are more and more of them .
So this is the Fotokite .
You give it a little twist .
That &apos;s kind of the way you communicate .
And there it goes .
So the interaction is super simple .
You can turn it on .
So I just shifted its position .
And it &apos;s really safe .
Live demos are hard , right ?
Things go wrong all the time .
What would you use it for ?
Thank you .
She was six .
Now let &apos;s get back to Naghma .
That &apos;s not how it works in Afghanistan .
Thanks .
I &apos;ve been temporarily detained .
It didn &apos;t go off , though .
Two hundred and eighty million .
She was severely beaten with metal rods .
They burned her body .
They used pliers to take out her fingernails .
It &apos;s a mystery .
There are lots of injuries .
Try one of two conditions .
you &apos;re much more likely to survive and not slip and fall .
and 20 percent of those nominations are people who nominate themselves .
Well , you get several things .
And that &apos;s where the idea came from .
Thank you .
I have a confession to make .
But they didn &apos;t test for curiosity .
Maybe you &apos;ve heard of her .
It &apos;s called Aquarius .
In other ways , it &apos;s a legacy .
It &apos;s available to every one of us .
We had never seen that before .
Nothing is impossible .
Thank you very much .
But it doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
I need to take a breath .
And of course mothers , because .
Why ?
Great , right ?
Thank you .
This man is my father .
He never lost consciousness .
I began again .
A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I.
This is a blessing . &quot;
It &apos;s in this world , &quot; he said .
I don &apos;t .
Everything has motion .
The heart pumps .
The body heaves .
The mouth moves .
We never stagnate .
Life triumphs up and down .
So begins life at 57 , he says .
Thank you .
Who bombed your house ?
Did the rest of your family make it out alive ?
But one day , the family got terrible news .
Their throats were slit .
It was time to flee .
Think about it this way , proportionately .
Well far from it .
They flee across borders like this one .
Thank you .
And imagine living in this camp .
University is a luxury .
Thank you .
Let me do a demonstration .
Thank you very much .
Sleep .
But that doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense , does it ?
We call it the CSF .
It &apos;s almost nothing .
Thank you .
I say , &quot; Here &apos;s my email address .
It &apos;s a very desolate place .
Thank you .
Thank you .
are wondering the same question .
Glenn Greenwald .
My father was a government worker .
Those sums of money are called remittances .
They actually act like an insurance .
It all goes in suitcases .
There are .
I cannot go to a cheaper option .
This has to go .
I was in Dubai a few years ago .
The remittance arrives .
This has to stop .
And it can be done .
My wife is a Venezuelan .
My children are Americans .
My parents are not there anymore .
Thank you .
We want our seat at the table .
And rightly so .
I don &apos;t have the answer , just in case .
I don &apos;t think anyone does .
And yes , we failed .
We were sent to play outside like little kids .
And I must be honest : I think , in hindsight , we were .
But it got attention .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
Thank you .
Some families have fewer children .
Some made bad investments .
Now , what could be done ?
This is a problem .
Expropriation is very tempting .
Thank you .
How likely do you think that it is that they will be implemented ?
What do you answer to that ?
The problem is , it &apos;s a question of degree .
Some of your data has been criticized .
This is part of what it is intended for .
So I have responded point by point to every concern .
Some of it will go in different directions .
Let &apos;s take a look .
I live there on the corner .
It started a couple of years ago .
Are you losing your mind ?
Here we go .
We &apos;re going through slices through my head like that .
So here &apos;s how this works .
All right ?
Patient : Okay .
Look at my face .
One , two , three .
Your face metamorphosed .
That was a trip .
Yes , we do .
Its students defy all norms .
Where would they train ?
And we &apos;re also part of the problem .
Haiti , January 2010 .
The pain .
Overwhelming .
It &apos;s not a question of competencies .
They &apos;ve done the heavy lifting .
Thank you .
I met her two years ago .
Here &apos;s what I mean by that .
Personal greatness .
Engaging the greatness in others .
And then they pretty much stopped .
So this is obvious , right ?
But how can it be ?
Well , there are primarily two ways .
And he was sincere about that .
Thank you .
And who does the emptying ?
I hope you can see him .
Thank you .
We traveled the country .
There has to be another way of doing this .
It &apos;s a very desirable place to live in .
It was the Cultural Revolution .
There were hardly any cars .
This is Hong Kong .
It &apos;s permeable .
That &apos;s measured in the winter solstice .
And Colombo .
Thank you .
to women &apos;s lives in Gaza .
Thank you .
Kenneth Cukier : Big data is better data
How do we know it ?
Because of data .
Why ? What happened ?
Okay , think about it .
You can get your first choice .
You have more data .
It allows us to see better .
It allows us to see different .
There is , if you will , a liquidity to information .
Take , for example , Martin Luther .
What could we do then ?
Well , think about it .
You have more information .
He played . He won .
He played . He won .
Arthur Samuel knew strategy .
He plays the computer . He wins .
He plays the computer . He wins .
How do you think we have self-driving cars ?
No . Memory is cheaper . No .
You figure it out .
The person went to university .
The person buys property .
He or she votes .
That &apos;s really important .
And let me start with cities .
Some things in cities can happen much more quickly .
Take my hometown , London .
And it happened all the time .
That &apos;s the way London was .
I remember the smogs well .
This was the 1950s .
Let me turn to energy .
We can see how to do that .
Take the example of California .
That &apos;s a striking achievement .
But we &apos;re losing our forests .
You can see better insulation .
Two weeks old .
What do you guys think ?
Yet , I feel honored .
So this is what inspired me .
It &apos;s a powerful engine .
What phenomenon is this ?
It could be a geyser .
I don &apos;t know of any .
In one day .
Just to give you an idea .
A gigantic kettle , right ?
50 thousand Itaipus .
It &apos;s on the line of deserts .
Where are the arteries ?
Any guess ?
It depends on this river .
This river has a pulse .
Here it is , pulsing .
Then , clouds are formed and there is torrential rain .
The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden .
There are other factors as well .
There is another fractal analogy .
It returns to the atmosphere .
That is no accident .
I &apos;m not talking only about the Amazon .
We need to do this .
How could he know that ?
I said , &quot; Gosh !
Out of sight , out of mind .
We live in ignorance .
I was educated by television .
It is a live carpet .
All invisible .
We are tech-arrogant .
Let &apos;s zoom in on it .
My time &apos;s up .
Thank you so much .
My grandfather was a cobbler .
Back in the day , he made custom-made shoes .
I never got to meet him .
So think about useful things .
Anybody ?
It wasn &apos;t made to measure .
She now wants to walk in high heels .
It doesn &apos;t stop there .
How about food ?
That will take new tools .
I think it &apos;s the wrong question to ask .
He passed away three years ago .
Thank you .
About the evolution of our universe .
So what does this tell us ?
Thank you .
Use this device . Use this device to answer .
Please answer A , B or C.
Oh , very , very good .
And we go to the next question .
A , B or C ? Please answer .
And we go to the next question .
A , B or C ?
Now , answers .
This is how they answered .
Now how did you do ?
That &apos;s you .
How long did women go to school ?
Yes , yes , yes , women have almost caught up .
And this is you . Here you come .
What about poverty ?
The world was two groups .
Well , it &apos;s me . It &apos;s me .
It &apos;s very difficult , this . It &apos;s very difficult .
Do we have any ideas ?
It was not representative . Okay ?
We have a personal bias .
It was good in evolution .
Of course you shouldn &apos;t .
How are you going to succeed ?
People don &apos;t have that time .
We need to be able to generalize .
Okay ? Don &apos;t go for the worse .
That was the first one .
It &apos;s a terrible inequality .
No , no , no . That &apos;s wrong .
Let &apos;s look at the last one .
That &apos;s a rule of thumb .
That &apos;s a systematic approach .
But this has changed , okay ?
Today it &apos;s 50 / 50 .
Let &apos;s move into the future .
In 2025 , 63 percent .
Thank you very much .
Dan Barasch : A park underneath the hustle and bustle of New York City
It &apos;s really pretty remarkable .
Thanks .
I &apos;m an industrial engineer .
Today , we are making forests in houses , in schools , even in factories with the corporates .
But that &apos;s not enough .
By sharing , we can actually bring back our native forests .
Hi , kids .
I &apos;m 71 .
My husband is 76 .
So let &apos;s talk about aging .
I am still 17 .
Sophia Loren . Look at her .
What have I gained ?
I love my brain .
I feel lighter .
It &apos;s great to let go .
I should have started sooner .
And I &apos;ve gained spirituality .
Meditation helps .
Ommm . Ommm . Ommm .
Isabel Allende : Ommm . Ommm . There it is .
And it &apos;s good to start early .
I want to be the center of attention .
I hate to be invisible .
This is Grace Dammann .
after a terrible car accident .
She doesn &apos;t see herself as disabled .
Attitude , attitude .
Yes to life .
Jubilation . Celebration .
We have paid our dues .
I am working on it every day .
Want to join me ?
Thank you .
I Oh , of course . About what ?
But really , what do you do , right ?
&quot; You wouldn &apos;t do this to your mothers or sisters . &quot;
So some called me a hypocrite .
It &apos;s a feeling .
But yet , it was simple .
Thank you .
That ended the discussion .
Go find us some insurance . &quot;
It &apos;s microinsurance .
The data alone isn &apos;t enough .
That &apos;s an attractive proposition .
How do you expect me to repay my loan ? &quot;
We &apos;ve got you .
No more years of the cup .
Thank you .
We get ever more vulnerable .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
He ate fabric . He ate things , recyclables .
He hunted flies that didn &apos;t exist .
He suffered from hallucinations .
And I was a — I &apos;d studied biology .
It cracked open my world .
So let &apos;s talk about diagnosis for a minute .
This is an example of shadow-chasing .
I know , and it &apos;s funny and in some ways it &apos;s cute .
Many animals develop mood disorders .
Lab rats pluck themselves too .
I want to be careful and be clear , though .
She would hide in the closet .
Or do you anthropomorphize poorly ?
Thank you .
I had never thought about any of that before .
But it meant the most to Jeannie .
I knew they would .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
TED is 30 .
Let &apos;s talk about the state .
I wrote the code .
You have your list .
How about we do that ?
Let &apos;s do that this year .
Fight for it for me . Okay ? Thanks .
Silence is the residue of fear .
Thank you .
Period . End of story .
Power has a negative moral valence .
How does a slogan become a movement ?
We begin to opt out .
This is emergent .
We have the power to do that .
Thank you very much .
He was strong , steady , disciplined .
In many ways , it was worse .
Guess what ?
It got quieter .
But isolation isn &apos;t good .
We were pretty good at putting out fires .
They were patient with me .
There were no toilets .
They were inspired .
Inmates are highly adaptive .
They have to be .
That was how we thought .
These are not opposing qualities .
We can do that .
Thank you .
I &apos;m not technical at all .
It has never happened . There are no examples .
It doesn &apos;t happen by itself .
How often can I go out to dinner ?
Are you sure ?
We disagree .
Of course it is .
This is nonsense .
It &apos;s essential to it .
Thank you .
Now , as a statistician , what &apos;s my response ?
Show me the data !
Show me the data !
Now , what does that data look like ?
Why is she sitting on them ?
You &apos;re having a heart attack .
We move around .
I &apos;m thinking , I was sleeping , honestly .
He gives us a prescription .
What story is this data telling you ?
You become the authority .
It &apos;s not hard to do .
I challenge you to take ownership of your data .
Audience : Show me the data !
TW : One more time !
Audience : Show me the data !
TW : Show me the data .
Thank you .
I have a problem .
I &apos;m fine .
I &apos;m not on fire .
And the thing is that I have a stutter .
And I do use that . I do .
Thank you .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Most of them were just your typical party photo .
But it didn &apos;t work .
Thank you .
Ze Frank : Are you human ?
Are we agreed ? Yes ?
Then let &apos;s begin .
Okay .
Yes .
Yes .
Good .
Mmm .
Yes , it &apos;s safe here .
Mmm .
Congratulations .
Quite clever .
It didn &apos;t like it . It doesn &apos;t like it cold .
It doesn &apos;t like it dry .
It is a biological computer .
This is where its intelligence lies .
This isn &apos;t hypothesis-driven .
We gave them beer as well .
Thank you .
I was born in Taiwan .
This is an automatic night light .
This sculpture has four eyes .
I love science and biology .
Thank you .
But it wasn &apos;t like that at all .
Remember this ?
Because what &apos;s the difference ?
That &apos;s what I set out to do .
I chose a spring .
I used this mechanism .
Right there .
But it didn &apos;t always look like this .
This was my first prototype .
What kind of trocar do you use ? &quot;
The truth is that &apos;s not always the case .
Puzzles and magic .
It &apos;s certainly true for me .
I &apos;ve been solving my whole life .
It &apos;s remarkable .
Like .
Chaos . Order .
Order .
And order .
Okay .
It &apos;s an eternal quest .
I &apos;m seeing some heads nod .
Come on guys , really ?
There we go . Smart audience .
Let &apos;s see .
Gwen , after you .
Are you so excited ?
It &apos;s going to be a lot of fun .
But I &apos;m going to go over here .
All right . Great .
Big scribbles .
Color in the owl .
Good , good , good , good , good .
Okay , good .
Yes , I think it does .
Let &apos;s take a closer look .
The plot thickens .
That one &apos;s my favorite .
Oh , and there &apos;s one more , there &apos;s one more .
There &apos;s more .
That &apos;s pretty cool , right ?
It &apos;s The New York Times .
But wait , wait , wait , wait . Wait .
That &apos;s chaos and order .
Thank you .
Thank you .
This is desktop gene sequencer .
Compass over maps .
Oh , they &apos;ve run out .
Thank you .
Now we might be wrong .
Or take bias .
We openly acknowledge it .
He got involved in different pursuits .
He helped out the war orphans .
It was entirely bogus .
This bias seems to show up very early .
And there are different avenues .
Smith says , that would matter a lot .
This is what a constitution is .
We have bound ourselves .
Thank you .
They control your phone .
Warfare .
It &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
You &apos;ve got the pictures you &apos;ve taken .
You &apos;ve got the music you listen to .
So I was frustrated , I was exhausted .
I do this for a living .
So what happened ?
But I had this epiphany .
My answer was vision .
If I can find this , I can &apos;t make the phone explode .
but all this tells me is what I &apos;m looking at .
This is an image of some sort .
And why is that ?
Second , judging .
Third , negativity .
You can fall into this .
Some people have a blamethrower .
It &apos;s difficult to listen to that .
So here they are , seven deadly sins of speaking .
Yes , there is .
See if you can guess .
The H , honesty , of course , being true in what you say , being straight and clear .
And the L is love .
Perhaps that &apos;s not necessary .
So hail .
Register , for example .
You hear the difference ?
That &apos;s register .
Then we have timbre .
Go and get a voice coach .
It can be very powerful .
And finally , volume .
Try not to do that .
Warm up your voice .
Actually , let me show you how to do that .
One more time .
Ahhhh , very good .
This is a serious point here .
Thank you .
Thank you .
It &apos;s tough .
And I said , &quot; Well , you know what ?
Does it have a symbol ?
Here are some examples .
Correct horse battery staple . &quot;
They ran the code .
So that was good news .
It &apos;s called &quot; Security Blanket . &quot;
So &quot; justin . &quot;
Or &quot; princess . &quot;
Is that a nickname ?
There &apos;s a lot of love in these passwords .
And that guy is really cute .
Thank you .
I didn &apos;t want to take responsibility .
He said , &quot; Dad , don &apos;t kill .
The first thing was , I had great mentors .
And I was like , &quot; What is K ? &quot;
The second thing was apologizing .
The third thing was atoning .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I really loved philosophy .
It wasn &apos;t who I was .
But that can &apos;t be right .
Not necessarily .
We &apos;ve got two jobs .
So how are we supposed to choose ?
Something seems to have gone wrong here .
But that can &apos;t be right .
There are only three possibilities .
Not so with values .
would enslave us to reasons .
Here &apos;s where I stand .
Here &apos;s who I am . I am for banking .
I am for chocolate donuts .
There is no best alternative .
We all know people like that .
I drifted into being a lawyer .
I wasn &apos;t for lawyering .
Thank you .
I do not write dictionaries .
Okay , many fewer .
about new pronunciations .
We are not a language academy .
Well , you know what ?
Thank you .
I stopped shaving .
I couldn &apos;t get out of bed in the morning .
You &apos;re going to get stuck .
And I call this place the cloud .
That &apos;s called blocking .
It &apos;s pulling us to the moon ! &quot;
We talk about the results .
That was unthinkable .
I thought , that &apos;s the way it is .
I was in the cloud .
Sounds like this .
Thank you for your backup singing .
Thank you .
And I feel the same way .
They scare us .
Open Sesame .
What would you do then ?
This is what Khalil did .
They &apos;ve uncovered corruption , abuse .
This worked .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Hack the planet !
And then it got even worse .
And this wasn &apos;t just an abstract question .
The name speaks for itself .
It was incredible .
Okay , are you registered to vote ?
We got to get you registered to vote .
I ain &apos;t voting on no gay shit .
SM : That &apos;s not cool .
So what made you be straight ?
They ain &apos;t got that power .
Who has that power ? Nobody .
SM : But you know what ?
I got you .
Y &apos;all want to do that ?
We feed you . We bring you pizza .
We are your mothers and brothers and sisters and sons .
Thank you .
Very effective .
This is the foot of a cockroach .
Robust systems are also damage resistant .
Here &apos;s an animal climbing up a wall .
Here &apos;s what they do .
Thank you .
It goes back 200 million years .
The environment changed very slowly .
It &apos;s about the thickness of a table napkin .
It could implement a pattern .
I &apos;ll give you a simple example .
Information flows down also .
That &apos;s funny . She &apos;s pretty . &quot;
So how are we doing today ?
And Jennings and the other guy didn &apos;t get that .
Let me summarize it for you . &quot;
He &apos;s coming my way .
I &apos;ve got three seconds .
I need a billion more . &quot;
It will grow exponentially .
They don &apos;t have the frontal cortex .
But the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different .
It &apos;ll be expanded without limit .
Thank you very much .
It was always a Faustian pact anyway .
He &apos;s the foreman of the shipyard .
Inside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother .
This is a big deal .
She acknowledges me . She waves , and she smiles .
And then she &apos;s gone .
I was infected .
I was infected with an idea .
I don &apos;t belong in this street .
I want a life that &apos;s out of the ordinary .
the answer is not really .
One of them is it &apos;s early days .
They &apos;re not going to help us .
That &apos;s not what we &apos;re looking for .
I want to give you two examples .
The first comes from San Francisco .
They went on to get AIDS .
They didn &apos;t get AIDS .
Where are we going to look ?
And let &apos;s look at a million individuals .
I would be willing to participate . &quot;
We asked Leif up in Finland .
What are our genes ? &quot;
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
The bear was a female .
And this is how the teddy bear was born .
Because think about the teddy bear .
These animals , they were being demonized .
I like polar bears .
So we can explain that failure two ways .
The first , well , it &apos;s pretty obvious .
Storytelling matters now .
Emotion matters .
Thank you .
&#91; Illustrations by Wendy MacNaughton &#93;
It was six miles long .
It was very intense .
There was no running water .
There was no way to bathe .
They never even got out of their clothes .
They fought . The worked .
There was no communication with the outside world up there .
There was no cooked food .
It was incredibly hot .
Usually , you &apos;re not scared .
Time slows down .
You get this weird tunnel vision .
It &apos;s hormonally supported .
It was machine gun fire .
Just think about the math on that .
They got back .
I had a dinner party one night .
What is he talking about ?
He &apos;s not a psychopath .
He doesn &apos;t miss killing people .
Friendship happens in society , obviously .
They thought he was dead .
It was in the middle of a huge firefight .
The bullet had just knocked him out .
It glanced off the helmet .
And he was thinking , &quot; I &apos;m not dead . &quot;
And he sat up .
That &apos;s brotherhood .
This wasn &apos;t invented recently .
That is terrifying .
Thank you very much .
I didn &apos;t come from a military family .
I &apos;m not a military brat .
I &apos;m going to send you to military school . &quot;
And I kept on getting lost .
I didn &apos;t ever feel like I was in danger .
That was the new reality .
&quot; Thank you for your service . &quot;
What was the experience like ? How are you doing ? &quot;
She barely survives .
So thank you for your service .
And I said , &quot; Pity ? &quot;
So as it turns out , I &apos;m the lucky one . &quot;
That became my mantra .
And that &apos;s what they did .
Perhaps I could .
I &apos;m glad we all get cake .
And I thought — Thank you .
Forge meaning . Build identity .
Forge meaning .
Build identity .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
She &apos;s a Polish poet .
&quot; The hour from night to day .
The hour from side to side .
The hour for those past thirty ... &quot;
Ronnie : Not at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
Those were all really solid examples .
People sent me magazine ads .
Take a look .
: The time is 4 a.m.
Rives : It shows the spectrum .
Here &apos;s your sampler .
Secondly , I did a little research .
There &apos;s a five in the morning .
What kind of person would do that ?
This kind of person would do that .
Everyone &apos;s still asleep in their comfy , comfy beds .
Rives : Exactly .
I started archiving .
It was brief .
And then I thought , &quot; Good for him . &quot;
&quot; PG &quot; is Slavic literature .
He analyzed it very carefully .
That &apos;s closing the circle .
What about humans ?
There are , indeed , problems .
It &apos;s all about culture .
Liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries .
You &apos;re part of the in-group .
I &apos;m fairly convinced that we do have them .
It &apos;s not about individual recognition .
You &apos;ll be dead .
There &apos;s lots to find .
Thank you very much .
That &apos;s how many zeros ?
Let &apos;s take appraisal fraud first .
Start with the industry .
It expanded remarkably as well .
What happened in the governmental sector ?
We had a 90 percent conviction rate .
What do we need to do ?
Thank you very much .
And the 21st century .
Yay !
That &apos;s the major thread .
I &apos;d like to play a song for you .
That was 1984 .
It &apos;s Throwback Thursday already .
I was in the middle .
These records don &apos;t really age that well .
It leaves the listener feeling sickly .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
So I did some calculations .
There are a few things that I looked at here .
I started with money .
You can also look at power .
How much room is that ?
And this is a lot of fun .
And sometimes not .
Thank you .
Say hello to EDI .
EDI , EDI .
It means &quot; forced labor . &quot;
They were not intelligent .
EDI is different .
EDI is real .
MT : He weighs 300 pounds .
MT : We love robots .
That &apos;s not true of the robot .
Now , this goes both ways .
EDI : Wow !
Accidents are inevitable .
EDI : Ow ! That hurt .
Abracadabra .
MT : Abracadabra ?
Come on , keep up .
EDI : I am EDI .
Thank you .
EDI : Thank you !
You come with him . &quot;
Harold and I arrive in New York .
We look like shiny new pennies .
&quot; We &apos;re here for the lunch . &quot;
She motions for us to follow her .
The blood drains from her face .
There are literally no words , right ?
But she knew .
I know how we got here .
There &apos;s no question about it .
I tell the uniform story because it happened .
And I failed a lot .
I &apos;m asking you to be bold .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thanks . Thanks .
There were Christians and Jews .
Right .
Okay .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s enough .
Who do we got ?
Hi , um , okay , hi everybody .
My name is Nereida .
Don &apos;t say , &quot; Oh my God . &quot;
It was really too much .
You know what I &apos;m saying .
Y &apos;all can see that right there .
That &apos;s how you hold it .
You know what I mean ?
You know what I &apos;m saying ?
Aight ? In the future or the present . Yeah .
Enjoy the rest of it .
Okay , next question .
What do you got ?
You know , that kind of thing .
Well , it is the future .
Thank you .
Like , I like my voice .
Okay . Next question .
And this guy &apos;s older .
Am I right , or am I right ?
I don &apos;t got nothing more to say .
All right , next question .
Next .
Tough crowd .
Who &apos;s here ?
I mean really fast .
No , I am teasing about that .
That is what I am trying to say .
Last answer .
How are people living today ?
I appreciate it . Bye-bye .
Thank you for trusting me , Chris .
It &apos;s the whole or it &apos;s nothing .
What does that mean ?
We &apos;re interested in the climate .
That is a huge challenge .
So what does a climate model look like ?
We do still use Fortran .
But how do we go about doing it ?
We do it one piece at a time .
We can look at the fluxes .
We can encapsulate that in code .
What happens when you have clouds ?
That &apos;s another piece .
All of those things are emergent properties .
This is all very good . This is all great .
The ozone hole changed the climate .
They &apos;re always approximations .
The answer is yes .
The first one is the model .
The second one are the observations .
Here are the choices that we have .
Thank you .
Power was rarely available .
This is something that has to happen .
But now we can .
Thank you .
Faster , Higher , Stronger .
An American sprinter jumps out to the front .
Listen to it again .
Only 530 are left .
Where does the record stand today ?
Yours is probably very nearly so .
There &apos;s no explosion there .
They have to run like this .
He &apos;s pulling up on a rope .
Amazing .
Thank you very much .
&quot; Why ? &quot;
He doesn &apos;t make eye contact .
They fit together in a pathway .
But that &apos;s not going to be the only answer .
Thank you .
This one &apos;s called &quot; The Chase . &quot;
So here &apos;s an example of what I mean .
There &apos;s no touchscreen .
Thank you .
Hamish Jolly : A shark-deterrent wetsuit
I wanted to test this idea .
on the doorstep here , with the Oceans Institute .
And Eduardo .
Cheers , mate .
Cheers .
Thank you .
It &apos;s my job .
There . Good .
The curves are kind of subtle .
What a contrast .
Well , I tell a lie .
Type is very adaptable .
There &apos;s the sort of aesthetic element .
I hope not .
This is not fine art .
Remember this reading experience ?
Designer to the rescue . &quot;
&quot; Oh , &quot; he said . &quot; What problem ? &quot;
&quot; Well , thank you for letting me know , &quot; I said .
Foiled again .
I persevered .
Forget its origins . Screw that .
I liked the design for its own sake .
I had really misunderstood the technology .
So did my typeface .
It was only a stopgap .
At that time , screens were binary .
The pixel was either on or it was off .
Not so with an O.
Is that a compromise ?
This is an S , in case you were wondering .
Thank you .
The universe is teeming with planets .
Now it &apos;s not resolved at all .
We have to get rid of it .
Well , what &apos;s going on ?
It separates from the telescope .
Thank you .
That &apos;s not science fiction .
So those are four petals .
You &apos;ll see the petals unfurl .
Now you &apos;re seeing it deploy .
Thank you .
It was , the first two were , &quot; It &apos;s a ... &quot;
&quot; A lesbian girl . &quot;
And so he did .
Does this make so-and-so straight ?
And my patient said to me , &quot; Look , look , look .
So what to do ?
And they fall apart .
That &apos;s how good it can be .
It was a horror show .
a male puberty .
And so here she is at 16 , on the left .
And on the far right , there she is .
It really says it all .
Now Nicole is on estrogen .
And then they finally got it .
They cost a fortune .
Thank you .
Thank you for indulging me .
I see anxiety .
But here &apos;s the thing .
Kids were considered economic assets .
And thank God it did .
And you know what ? I &apos;m doing okay .
I pay my taxes .
I hold down a steady job .
Guess what it was ?
But it is a very elusive one .
Can I just repeat that ?
I whispered it into his ear .
Thank you .
You don &apos;t have the depth of conviction .
You don &apos;t have an emotional sonorousness .
People don &apos;t realize that .
I certainly didn &apos;t .
Gabby Giffords : Yes .
Yeah , that was it .
I do .
She works incredibly hard every day .
So you meet .
What attracts you to Gabby ?
GG : No , no , no .
A good friend .
Where &apos;d we go , Gabby ?
GG : Death row .
You were willing to go to death row , after all .
I guess .
GG : Fast pace . Fast pace .
GG : Nelson .
GG : Grateful .
It &apos;s not too difficult to do that .
Take a look at Gabby .
This is a couple months ago .
Mountains . Gorgeous mountains .
He started doing better .
GG : Yes .
PM : What a wonderful moment .
GG : Thank you .
Hello , everyone .
Be passionate . Be courageous .
Thank you . GG : Thank you .
David Sengeh : The sore problem of prosthetic limbs
Thank you very much .
Can you guess what this is ?
Shark skin .
A caterpillar &apos;s mouth .
The eye of a fruit fly .
An eggshell .
A flea .
A snail &apos;s tongue .
Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives .
We &apos;ll just have to see .
Thank you .
Right now .
Guess where those places are ?
Who here has been to a black church ?
We got a couple of hands .
Audience : Amen .
Magic can be taught .
Magic can be taught .
Now , how do you teach it ?
Thank you .
They are what makes it come alive .
And it was green .
Well , I didn &apos;t have any idea .
So what were we going to do ?
It &apos;s not something you can just fake .
And so I began walking .
I had to have faith .
And it did .
You tap into your humanity .
I mean , would you want to go there ?
Would you want to stay there ?
Can you see into it and out of it ?
Are there other people there ?
The High Line was an elevated railway .
Well no , it would not be terrific .
Thank you .
Thank you .
This is Martin Niemöller .
You &apos;re familiar with his poetry .
Then they came for the trade unions .
Then they came for the Jews .
And then they came for me .
We could call it cluefulness .
Cows , not so much .
He &apos;s Tim &apos;s friend .
As a citizen . &quot;
He didn &apos;t tell . He asked questions .
We &apos;ve got to end the bovinity of this political society .
Because I had to focus .
Hope .
I &apos;m not going to fail that .
And then finally number three , the hardest .
And the basic way this works is this .
Here &apos;s my wish .
May one .
Aaron asked me that .
Now I &apos;ve asked you .
Thank you very much .
that were most indicative of high intelligence .
So this is pretty complicated stuff , right ?
so users control their data .
Thank you .
We were already engaged to be married .
What &apos;s this about ?
How do you navigate that ?
That &apos;s down to a few hundred thousand .
Does that drive you crazy ?
It &apos;s a kid , one kid at a time .
It is not all a panacea .
How have you guys managed it ?
That just wouldn &apos;t work out . &quot;
I was actually really excited .
That &apos;s cool .
Including some of the employees .
She &apos;s got a lot of insight .
What about failure , though ?
Well , we got hundreds of ideas .
Maybe a few of those will work out .
Jenn &apos;s been to Tanzania .
Anna and Sanare are the parents .
She was very , very shy .
Oh , wow .
How have you managed it ?
What &apos;s been your approach ?
How on Earth did that happen ?
Yes .
How is that going ?
People give to some things . We look and go , &quot; Wow . &quot;
We need more experimentation .
What &apos;s the pitch ?
Is that a fair comment ?
MG : But you change systems .
All right , good job .
There &apos;s no risk involved .
Sounds straightforward , right ?
There &apos;s no threat involved .
People do weird things .
We &apos;ll start off easy .
Seems pretty straightforward .
So what do I do ?
I visualize catastrophe .
This is my cat , Eli .
Well , here &apos;s one possibility .
There &apos;s geodata .
It &apos;s not .
Thank you .
Ed Yong : Zombie roaches and other parasite tales
This is Artemia , a brine shrimp .
It &apos;s actually the exact opposite .
This is a suicidal cricket .
But there &apos;s more to it than that .
No .
Now , the caterpillar didn &apos;t die .
The cat eats the rat . Toxo gets to have sex .
We don &apos;t really know .
This has no nervous system .
It has no consciousness .
We are mammals .
Thank you .
Good morning .
Life was good .
I loved this place .
Not bad .
Enough ancient history .
So what came after the moon ?
So what &apos;s next ?
So what is next ?
Now you &apos;re thinking , give me a break .
Thank you .
We appreciate you joining us .
What did you make of it ?
They &apos;re all great citizens .
They actually do .
That &apos;s not how it works .
But I will tell you this .
It &apos;s the bringer of knowledge to all .
It &apos;s the connector of all .
And so that &apos;s the public characterization .
Is there such a right ?
Do they have any privacy rights ?
Is there anything to that ?
Second is the denial-of-service attacks .
Would that be the point of view ?
Isn &apos;t there something to that ?
RL : Yeah .
He didn &apos;t come over like a crazy man .
Do you still think that ?
I &apos;ll defer to them .
Go Dallas .
Look at the data .
Thank you so much .
And really , that is unfair .
Well , the answer is , yes you can .
It could be another company .
Well , that &apos;s no problem either .
Over 200 people died .
And so I come to my wish .
Well , there is only one way .
There is such an opportunity right now .
You really can make this change happen .
That is momentum .
But it &apos;s early days .
Thank you .
And why did you do it ?
And we &apos;re alive .
It &apos;s an amazing experience .
Maybe it &apos;s spiders .
A lot of people are afraid of spiders .
And how do you know ?
The danger is entirely different than the fear .
How do you get around it , though ?
It would make you nervous and worried .
He could come over and help me . &quot;
I could find my own way back .
It &apos;s not nearly as big a deal .
Thank you .
Meet Joe .
I sat down .
I looked at Joe .
There was something else .
At first , this isn &apos;t perfect .
So can brains change ?
That was the dogma .
The evidence is actually the other way .
Thank you .
Betsy Ross was a hacker .
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack .
So what does civic hacking look like ?
They actually love it .
Thank you .
Now what does this tell us ?
There were no strangers . Right ?
So it &apos;s a very interesting aspect of human sexuality .
Now , this evidence goes way beyond anatomy .
These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China .
The biological father is a nonissue .
Thank you .
So a question .
Everyone has to respond to the modern world .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to get at .
I mean , come on , really ?
Hesta .
You gotta love the Aussies , right ?
and the sixth largest in the world .
It &apos;s eyes rolling , eyes rolling .
They &apos;re compatible .
A lot of it .
I mean , a really lot of it .
Thank you .
because it &apos;s an important principle .
I &apos;d go further .
Thank you very much for listening to me .
What is complex ?
Well , complex is not complicated .
Then comes a perturbation : milk .
is another example of a complex system .
Which brings us to bats .
Simple , individual rules .
But it gets better .
This is where meerkats live .
I &apos;m sure you know meerkats .
They &apos;re fascinating creatures .
They simply move together .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s it .
I &apos;d like to reimagine education .
It starts with an M.
Now , our classrooms could use change .
What &apos;s changed ?
The seats are in color .
Whoop-de-do .
Even the infrastructure has to change .
Everything has to change .
Everything really has to change .
I call it teen-lish .
&quot; Honey , come over for dinner . &quot;
&quot; Hmm . &quot;
&quot; Did you hear me ? &quot;
Silence . &quot; Can you listen to me ? &quot;
I said , no , that must have been by accident .
I said , this is great .
I text her , she responds .
They can have discussions amongst themselves .
They can solve problems together .
One idea is active learning .
You teach by asking questions .
They can hit the pause button .
They can rewind the professor .
Heck , they can even mute the professor .
Fifth is peer learning .
Let me tell you a story .
This is happening today .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Disengaging their colleagues .
They are obsolete .
Let &apos;s take an example .
making cars easy to repair .
It is basically the interplay .
The connections , the interactions , the synapses .
Who will pay for that ?
Shareholders ? Customers ?
No , they will refuse .
What happens one year later ?
It is totally wrong .
It is even counterproductive .
By removing layers .
We will cooperate .
Remove the second TV .
It changes everything .
This is rubbish , very abstract .
Thank you .
The first of these is politics .
That second red line is religion .
Audience : Sex .
Audience : Sex .
Audience : Sex .
Hot stuff !
no matter where we live and love .
Thank you .
Stephen Cave : The 4 stories we tell ourselves about death
What did it mean that he was dead ?
Where had he gone ?
And that &apos;s frightening . It &apos;s terrifying .
They work like this .
They were then asked again about their religious beliefs .
Twice as likely .
Even though the before they were all equally agnostic .
I want to live on in my apartment . &quot;
And so it should be with us .
Thank you .
Okay , a few of you .
So what is a glacier ?
This cave was amazing .
Thank you very much .
I grew up in wonder .
Ubuntu : I am because of you .
Ubuntu is at play right now .
He then moved across into what we called the habitat team .
We worked together as a team .
Solly remained on the bank .
He turns . He begins to make his way to me .
It goes to bite me a second time .
The bone is cracked .
The meat is torn up .
I make an instant decision that I &apos;ll never look at that again .
He comes straight into the channel .
He gets to me . He grabs me .
He turns . He walks me up the bank .
He lays me down . He pulls his shirt off .
And I survive .
Danger is shared . Pain is shared .
Joy is shared . Achievement is shared .
Houses are shared . Food is shared .
And then I met this young lady .
And then one day we came across them at this small water hole .
Thank you .
Boyd Varty : Well thanks , Pat .
He was suffering .
Anywhere he went , things went well .
That is not just poetry .
It doesn &apos;t take Ph.D. &apos; s .
They also have great capacity .
Take for example the case of lions .
The colors are going to be going from red to blue .
That &apos;s in the reds and yellows .
The forest is on the left .
Thank you .
So the first thing we need is more thumbs .
That is not how you win .
We can really go for it .
So you can see up here .
Perfect .
So this is the kind of simple level , right ?
But there are advanced configurations .
This is called the Death Star Configuration .
And this one &apos;s called the Möbius Strip .
Any science geeks , you get that one .
Everybody , up up up up up !
Stand up , my friends .
All right .
Don &apos;t start wrestling yet .
Okay . We need to do a last-minute thumb check .
Grab that thumb !
Any other thumbs ?
Okay ? One , two , three , go !
All right .
So curiosity .
We had some contentment .
And the last emotion of pride .
You lost both your thumbs .
So congratulations .
How many of you won just won thumb ?
Did anybody win both their thumbs ?
Yes . Awesome . Okay .
Wooo ! Thank you .
Amy Webb : How I hacked online dating
And I thought , you know , what &apos;s wrong with me ?
You &apos;ve got to date around .
So that wasn &apos;t going to work .
So again , I started doing some math .
Are the families going to get along ?
So I decided to sign on .
Now , there was one small catch .
In fact , he didn &apos;t even bother looking at the menu .
And listen , I &apos;m a modern woman .
I am totally down with splitting the bill .
&quot; You &apos;re just being too picky . &quot;
Well , it turns out that these probably weren &apos;t bad guys .
There were just bad for me .
I &apos;m not looking for a pen pal .
I &apos;m looking for a husband . Right ?
So there &apos;s a certain amount of superficiality in that data .
So I said fine , I &apos;ve got a new plan .
Well , as it turns out , this worked pretty well .
So I go back online now .
And I thought , I &apos;ve done it !
I &apos;ve cracked the code .
She listed her job as teacher .
She said she is &quot; silly , nice and friendly . &quot;
She likes to make people laugh &quot; alot . &quot;
I really was just scraping their data .
But I didn &apos;t want everybody &apos;s data .
And as it turns out , content matters a lot .
And finally , there were the photos .
How soon are you going out ? &quot;
It was enough for a date .
In fact , it &apos;s something that you write yourself .
Now , your matzoh balls .
They should be fluffy , not hard . &quot;
And I &apos;ll take her advice on that .
He &apos;s 6 foot 9 .
So he says , &quot; All right . &quot;
He says , &quot; I can &apos;t wear this stuff . &quot;
That &apos;s all he &apos;s carrying .
They were incredibly accurate .
Saul has the same expectation .
That &apos;s where his strength lies .
There &apos;s a second piece of this that &apos;s important .
Now that is weird , right ?
He &apos;s not even carrying a sword .
There have been many articles written .
He had acromegaly .
Because he can &apos;t see him .
Thank you .
So he got the right weight at birth .
He got the right Apgar index .
So we were pretty reassured by this .
So life had to change .
And that has been really a tough time .
And what went wrong ?
Will he be able to be normal ?
He was looking at us .
We were his mirror .
Mario !
Thank you . Thank you . Bye .
Thank you .
It really is .
Why didn &apos;t you come here in the first place ? &quot;
This is one of them , because I love cake .
So this is the bit I &apos;m really scared of .
And I am not a musician . It seemed like a good idea at the time .
And it has really good response time .
Okay . Thanks .
And there &apos;s a couple of other things .
Oh , yes . I just love doing that .
Yay !
So that &apos;s pretty much what I do .
So thank you very much .
and &quot; Bless the Lord ! &quot;
Quite the contrary .
This isn &apos;t faith .
It &apos;s difficult and stubborn .
I &apos;m not convinced of this .
Call this naive if you like .
I think not .
Thank you .
Thank you .
There was no responsibility .
They are special . They are outliers .
What does it mean ?
This is a super-exponential growth .
Why would you believe me ?
The Chinese government is there .
You influenced the market .
It was not a prediction . &quot;
Now , this is interesting .
The next day , the market started to change regime , course .
So there are bubbles everywhere .
Governing is the art of planning and predicting .
Failure of leadership .
Let &apos;s start from the beginning .
Soldiers storm the door .
They find me up on the top terrace .
But time we didn &apos;t get .
We were led by our fears .
They serve the demos , democracy .
So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora ?
It is in their interest that all of us are idiots .
Balancing a pole is hard .
Or do they ?
There simply isn &apos;t enough time .
Take this quad , for example .
Okay , here goes .
Whew !
Thank you .
How did I do this ?
The second aspect is love .
I &apos;ve been in love with this guy since I was a kid .
His career I admire a lot .
They are objects of desire .
Thank you .
They have social knits that are very close .
And then they disappear .
Thank you very much .
What &apos;s your reticence ?
Hendrik Poinar : I don &apos;t think it &apos;s reticence .
HP : Thank you .
So let &apos;s talk for a moment about race .
Mary is the object . Good sentence .
&quot; Mary was beaten by John . &quot;
We have to ask a different set of questions .
How does all this work ?
How can we change the practices ?
It &apos;s called kill the messenger .
You &apos;d better sit down and shut up , basically .
What about all those boys ?
There &apos;s a whole spectrum .
I don &apos;t appreciate that kind of talk . &quot;
There &apos;s been an awful lot of silence .
By the way , we owe it to women .
There &apos;s no question about it .
They didn &apos;t make the choice .
Thank you very much .
And a couple of things struck me about this .
And a good place to start is your own paycheck .
So here &apos;s a story .
And that &apos;s a good thing .
And that began with open-source software .
That really is an industrial revolution .
Of course , the house is never finished .
A kind of Wikipedia for stuff ?
Thank you very much .
Hey guys .
And you know , it had a profound effect on me .
We won &apos;t bring anything with us .
He doesn &apos;t know , but he can show you . &quot;
I didn &apos;t show him .
I &apos;m going to use them a different way . &quot;
So let me show you a little demo .
But this is not what &apos;s awesome .
A pencil is not just a pencil .
Look what it has in the middle of it .
You can make one of these brushes just on the fly .
Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin .
Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive , and you can use those together .
And so I just want to do a quick demo .
So I &apos;ll just plug it in , and now it &apos;s on by USB .
You guys are facing that way , so I &apos;ll hook it to this one .
And so we &apos;re like , &quot; We gotta put a video out about this . &quot;
And we actually sent this guy materials .
And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways .
See where it says &quot; sister &quot; ?
Thank you .
It doesn &apos;t have air conditioning .
That &apos;s a Boeing 707 .
But you know what the actual facts are ?
Negative .
This led to a fantasy .
Well , it &apos;s a matter of arithmetic .
We have a lot of debt .
All the rest went to the top one percent .
So that brings us down to 0.8 .
The bedrooms were cold . They were unheated .
We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound .
Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm .
Here &apos;s an early computer .
You have to choose either option A or option B.
Thank you .
So this looks something like this .
We &apos;re now going to turn it on .
It &apos;s on . Just turned it on .
And this works like that , instantly .
We want you to stop doing that . &quot;
And we do that with electricity .
There are eight children in the family .
Five of them have dystonia .
So here he is .
So he is one of five kids .
He did not respond to any drugs .
It is the sadness center of the brain .
And so patients with depression have hyperactivity .
Anybody interested in that ?
Of course we can , right ?
we &apos;re going to try to turbocharge the memory circuits in the brain .
Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again ?
So this is now in clinical trials .
We can introduce electrodes within those circuits .
Thank you very much .
How ?
What are you doing ?
Most people choose to lease .
Pretty good deal .
How on Earth have you done that ?
How &apos;s it going ?
What is it about you ?
I don &apos;t have a good answer for you .
And you have to do that .
It &apos;s really counterintuitive .
Learn from this man .
Look at that . Just take a bow . That was fantastic .
Thank you so much .
So let me start with this .
There &apos;s nothing done to this image .
Move away from it and come back to it .
Oh , that is so cool .
Okay , so are you all ready ?
One , two , three . Go !
Audience : Whooooooo !
So I thought I &apos;d talk about identity .
Why ?
And I love that picture .
Because that was very interesting , watching that experience as an old person .
I should stop saying it like that .
She was very upset .
So you &apos;ve got to give them your Facebook password .
She was a kid !
That &apos;s what she should have said .
So the teacher can &apos;t log into Facebook until she gets home .
The teacher logged in , she knows .
You have lots of identities .
So I thought , well , look .
Sure . They sign me in .
There &apos;s my visitor &apos;s badge .
But it &apos;s not real security .
There &apos;s no point in sending that message .
That message will only happen if I &apos;m anonymous .
I think this is a solvable problem .
Come on , you guys must have seen Doctor Who &apos;s psychic paper .
But nothing else .
Right .
Is that just a pipe dream ?
The technology already exists .
We have the technology to do that .
So the technology already exists .
They don &apos;t need to be special .
This was a very special case .
And two days later , this package shows up on your doorstep .
So I &apos;m here to tell you it &apos;s that guy right there .
And I started thinking about it again .
I &apos;m like , that was the idea !
You stand up , I &apos;ll squat down .
Here is a warehouse .
So the process is very productive .
They sorted it out for themselves .
She puts out her hand . The product jumps into it .
Or she has to reach in and get it .
She scans it and she puts it in the bucket .
Thank you .
Is there a real you ?
And so forth .
Here &apos;s the common-sense idea .
There is you .
You will have beliefs .
We have knowledge .
We have sensations and experiences as well .
You are the sum of your parts .
Let &apos;s take something like water .
Now my science isn &apos;t very good .
We all know that .
Of course we don &apos;t .
The term I use in the book , I call it the ego trick .
It &apos;s like a mechanical trick .
There is no real you .
Go back to the watch .
Let &apos;s take something like a waterfall .
For one thing , it &apos;s always changing .
That &apos;s not true .
Thank you very much .
How about we use that ? Combine that with number three .
Why do you think that &apos;s so ?
There &apos;s two types of algae growing .
We actually have a solution for that .
And the answer is : yes .
We are being very successful so far .
Now , here &apos;s one of the problems .
We do not use chemical fertilizer .
The 20 percent that &apos;s missing is nitrogen and phosphorous .
Now we get to Chaetomorpha .
So , water , fuel and food .
There &apos;s something missing to be complete .
So I was very surprised about this .
Is it worth it to you ?
But that was me years ago .
Good plan .
Sounds great , right ?
It &apos;s a huge problem .
And that &apos;s huge .
Thank you .
They &apos;re everywhere .
Stop the use of incense and candles .
Thank you .
Lisa Ling : Right .
Your winners .
I could be as tall as I wanted !
And I began to daydream .
I had no idea what to expect .
It &apos;s not about breaking down borders .
Thank you .
It &apos;s about disillusionment .
It &apos;s about death .
I don &apos;t believe in straightforward narratives .
I &apos;m colorblind .
I traveled to the Gaza Strip .
And that was exciting -- that was fun .
It was really interesting .
I lived the high-life .
The Foreign Office was very generous .
It was nice .
What was I going to do ?
And this wasn &apos;t a pretty thing .
And I started to fall .
My pension was in it .
And I gave it up .
And what was I going to do ?
18 people were killed .
It was anarchy .
But that was one of the reasons .
They were not allowed diplomats .
And Kosovo became independent .
And watching ? What If !
Us .
Something &apos;s got to be done about this .
Come back to us in maybe six months . &quot;
That &apos;s my story . Thanks .
This is the environmental conditions on the planet .
These include , of course , climate .
This is a new paradigm .
But is it happening anywhere ?
So crisis leading into opportunities .
Now , what about the future ?
And we need a transformation .
And what shall we do ?
You get people out of poverty .
So , there is scientific evidence .
Thank you .
That is the resource that I &apos;m talking about .
I call it cognitive surplus .
Designing .
What could be bad ? &quot;
But that &apos;s not right .
This is , I think , the range that matters .
for each other .
That will be true year-in and year-out .
That , we get for free .
Thank you very much .
This is their wedding video .
You may have seen it .
There &apos;s musical labels .
Thank you .
So , as I was saying ...
You see , he &apos;s right .
Well , I do .
And it &apos;s not true of enough people .
I love that .
I love that word , &quot; disenthrall . &quot;
You know what it means ?
Now , doing this is easier said than done .
Are there any people here under the age of 25 ?
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches .
&quot; Like , how lame is that ? &quot;
&quot; It has multiple functions . &quot;
Let me give you a couple of examples .
Certain sorts of college .
And I said , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m a fireman . &quot;
He said , &quot; But I wanted to be a fireman . &quot;
This linearity thing is a problem .
When I arrived in L.A.
No , it doesn &apos;t .
It doesn &apos;t .
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten .
They &apos;re three .
One is fast food , where everything is standardized .
It just wouldn &apos;t work .
But it &apos;s not only about that .
It &apos;s about passion .
There are many great models .
And I wanted to just very quickly ...
And we should tread softly .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
I want to talk about penguins today .
things die when there &apos;s no food .
I &apos;m just going to talk about two things .
So this is Turbo .
What is this guy doing ?
This is really pretty weird . &quot;
And now look at this : not friendly .
OK .
So , thank you very much .
Why him ?
I call it the golden circle .
Why ? How ? What ?
And why should anyone care ?
Let me give you an example .
Want to buy one ? &quot;
In fact , they tried .
Not psychology , biology .
It just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
Everybody was trying it .
Money was no problem .
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different .
He was in pursuit of the result .
He was in pursuit of the riches .
It &apos;s a commercial example .
They were extremely well-funded .
Market conditions were fantastic .
They &apos;ve never made money .
You &apos;re scaring us . &quot;
But he had a gift .
Zero .
They &apos;re not inspiring anybody .
But then what ?
All of these were released by us .
Thank you very much .
&quot; Hello ? Hey . &quot;
All right ? That &apos;s the first time .
&quot; Hello ? Uh , hey . &quot;
&quot; Hello ? Uh , who ?
Oh , hey . &quot;
Behavioral markers matter .
It was right around New Years .
This is a map of the entire world .
And in fact , it &apos;s upon us .
I just extended it . &quot;
You know , this is the mainframe .
Now , I &apos;m not anti-hospital .
And this is mainframe healthcare .
We are obsessed with this way of thinking .
It &apos;s population-based .
We &apos;ve got to focus on the home .
She tripped over her oxygen tank .
It &apos;s a research platform .
This is actually sensor firings .
It &apos;s about a year &apos;s worth of data .
It &apos;s just a mess today .
Thanks very much .
And the bus is full of people .
Nature is my greatest inspiration .
Seaweed , ebbing in the tide .
So , I &apos;m using quite a lot of radiation .
So , still working with film , I &apos;m afraid .
So , this is , again , my daughter &apos;s dress .
But there are four X-ray plates .
I kid you not .
It &apos;s whatever takes my fancy , really .
It &apos;s cumulative .
It has human connotations .
And it &apos;s just a bit spooky .
Look at this monster .
It &apos;s just happening .
Yeah , I &apos;m quite pleased with it .
And that &apos;s the sort of thing I &apos;ve been doing .
And this is quite a good way of doing it .
Would you describe that as global citizenship ?
But it &apos;s not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities .
So , you &apos;re on vacation at a nice beach , and word comes through that there &apos;s been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach .
And I think , look at the tsunami , it &apos;s a classic example .
Where was the early warning systems ?
So you &apos;re building on something that is not pure self-interest .
But they are now out of date . They don &apos;t deal with the problems .
So , I come back to my initial point .
Sometimes you think things are impossible .
All these things have happened .
GB : We have a responsibility to protect .
We &apos;ve never had this before because Kyoto didn &apos;t work .
But we did get an agreement on climate change .
But more progress has been made , I think , in the last few weeks than had been made for some years .
And we would help them make the transition to a low carbon economy .
When the IMF was created in the 1940s , it was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world &apos;s GDP .
It can &apos;t really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis .
So , we &apos;ve got to rebuild the world institutions .
And God said , &quot; Not this year , not in this decade , perhaps not in your lifetime . &quot;
So Barroso walked away crying and in tears .
GB : Well , thank you .
The aluminum is because it &apos;s very light .
So it allows it to roll .
And I thought up a lot of ideas .
The thing is , is that it &apos;s slightly dangerous .
And that &apos;s what supports the object and keeps it stable .
And here is a similar sculpture .
That &apos;s the Sun at that end .
This is a little stone ball , floating .
And so this is the size of the Sun .
This is in Sapporo .
So you can see it rotating here .
It &apos;s made of stainless steel , quite thick .
But it &apos;s being balanced like that in equilibrium .
It &apos;s susceptible to motion by the air currents .
This is another species of work that I do .
These were white spheres .
This is a clock I designed .
I came with a plan .
It &apos;s like a traveling show .
Here the legs are retracting .
It weighs about 20 tons .
It has on-board generators .
Or this could represent a college green .
So that &apos;s pretty much it .
Okay . Thank you .
It &apos;s poking and prying with a purpose . &quot;
We thought everyone could participate .
They use analysis as well .
And folks say we need to choose either or .
Intuitive versus analytical ?
And guess what ?
And education is not keeping up .
That &apos;s the intuitive .
&quot; And does it know its place ? &quot;
The balance . Thank you very much .
There was little to warn of the danger ahead .
That &apos;s where we &apos;re at right now .
Now , I need to be clear here .
And this raises a bigger worry for me .
Now , this could be a good thing .
They call it war porn .
It was set to music .
I think about this with a sports parallel .
The enemy has a vote .
What is unmanned slaughter ?
But robots are emotionless .
Thank you .
I review gadgets and stuff .
It &apos;s really cute .
I can &apos;t figure out why !
I &apos;m not plugging T-Mobile .
The answer is , &quot; All the time ! &quot;
going like this .
It also works the other way .
Now you get it .
This is another favorite of mine .
Excuse me one second .
Hello ?
Oh . Where are you calling from ?
Oh great ! Yeah . Yeah you can all stop calling now !
I have your numbers now !
You will pay .
Very , very customizable .
Here it comes .
It works with weather , too .
This is called Google Info .
Number Two . Number Two . Two .
Why do I listen to people in the audience ?
Well anyway -- oh ! Here we go !
Google : Hold on .
It &apos;s just so amazing .
What &apos;s the recipe for a certain cocktail ?
&quot; Which actors have played James Bond ? &quot;
You know . It &apos;s just absolutely amazing .
Nobody has pagers anymore .
Of course I want to listen to the messages !
Oh ! You all have cell phones too .
Sorry . I &apos;m not bitter .
It is a life-changer .
Hey , I was walking along the street and the sky was blue .
OK , talk to you later -- bye .
I love my job .
What the f -- ?
And lastly , I just have to talk about this one .
Phone : Hey you , what &apos;s going on ?
Phone : Well , that &apos;s good .
DP : What are you doing ?
I don &apos;t think so . &quot;
- you know . I &apos;m not .
What &apos;s the problem ?
&quot; Who the hell is this ? &quot;
Of course . You shake it .
Touch screen -- very , very nice .
Sorry , that was mean .
And now the end is near .
A made-in-Hell phone .
I too will join the cult .
You had me from , &quot; Hello . &quot;
I want to wipe the smudges clean .
It &apos;s all the things a phone should be .
Thank you . Thank you very much .
Bill Gates : Mosquitos , malaria and education
It &apos;s a phenomenal thing .
And the disease was all over the world .
So it was everywhere .
Now , baldness , it &apos;s a terrible thing .
And rich men are afflicted .
And bed nets are a great tool .
It &apos;s great to see .
And so you end up with two choices .
Now we &apos;re on the upswing .
Bed net funding is up .
There &apos;s new drug discovery going on .
I had great teachers .
And we have to change this .
And that doesn &apos;t seem entirely fair .
What does that mean ?
We should retain those people .
What do they look like ?
And the answer is no .
One is seniority .
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power .
It &apos;s an unbelievable thing .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
The data isn &apos;t gathered .
And they need advanced notice to do that .
Thank you .
Paula Scher : Great design is serious , not solemn
My work is play .
Be serious , it says .
Being solemn is easy .
Being serious is hard .
Poker is serious .
New York is serious .
Serious design is imperfect .
It &apos;s great to be a kid .
I just hated Helvetica .
There was no format .
There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to .
New Yorkers look at their feet .
And it was serious play .
Extruded typography that &apos;s backlit with neon .
And then , inexpensive signage .
It &apos;s a performing arts school .
And that began to make it solemn .
That was the play part of the job .
Here &apos;s the United States .
I keep that for evidence .
Thank you very much .
For me , I really love this idea .
Do you have a need for speed ?
Aqua Rocket : coming this summer .
Now this is important for two reasons .
There &apos;re a few different versions of it .
An olive server .
You sir , come on up .
Come on up . Tell everybody your name .
Steve Jurvetson : Steve .
Right there . That &apos;s great .
And hold onto this . Good luck to you .
No , not yet .
SJ : It &apos;s cold .
It &apos;s perfectly clear , it &apos;s odorless , it &apos;s colorless .
All right , well thanks for coming up .
SJ : Excellent , thank you .
You can circulate it to draw the heat away .
Old Milk Carton : Oh yeah , it smells good .
Who are you ?
New Milk Carton : I &apos;m New Milk .
So , a patient can come in and actually blow into their device .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Time for some thermodynamics .
who talked about absorption and refrigeration .
But it was kind of an interesting thought .
So , this is the way it works .
Thank you .
Do you think there could ?
Audience : No .
Why ?
What did Darwin say ?
And 100 pages later .
And another 100 pages later .
You see the idea ?
If , if , if , then .
What do you think my favorite word is ?
Audience : Chaos .
Audience : Without .
SB : No , not without .
You try them all in order : Mmm ... ?
Audience : Must .
SB : Must , at must . Must , must .
You can &apos;t stop it .
Must is my favorite word there .
It selfishly copies .
Ah , yes , there is .
This is design process going on .
It &apos;s important to stick with that definition .
Stick with the definition .
So , let &apos;s see some memes .
There are plenty more in the shops .
Audience : Bathroom soap .
SB : Pardon ?
Audience : Soap .
Audience : SB : Mmm mmm .
Audience : Sink , toilet !
What is this one doing ?
This has spread all over the world .
Some people get carried away .
What is this all about ?
So , think of it this way .
Now , why is this important ?
Language must have been useful for the genes .
But that &apos;s not all .
Because the processes are getting different .
And we &apos;re getting there .
Is there anyone else out there ?
It &apos;s been very productive , that equation .
I think that &apos;s the wrong way to think about it .
A very simple equation .
That was dangerous , all right .
Think of the big brain .
You know all about big brains .
Ah , mm -- slightly different .
Has it been tried before ?
What about all those other species ?
What happened to the others ?
That &apos;s how it seems to us .
What &apos;s going to happen ?
What does it mean to pull through ?
Well , there are kind of two ways of pulling through .
And why would they do that ?
Because we are self-replicating .
We have babies .
So , those are the two possibilities .
The first , it &apos;s coming too .
Maybe we will , maybe we won &apos;t .
I have no idea .
And it &apos;s a number of projects .
That would be the answer .
It &apos;s only the beginning of the problem .
I mean , major transformation .
You can measure it again .
In other words , water is the lifeblood .
And that &apos;s a concerted platform .
Thank you very much .
Jill Bolte Taylor : My stroke of insight
I need them in the morning . &quot;
You muscles , you relax . &quot;
And I felt this sense of peacefulness .
I gotta focus . &quot;
This is so cool . &quot; &quot; This is so cool !
&quot; I don &apos;t have time for a stroke ! &quot;
Thank you very much .
SP : My pleasure .
No , you &apos;ve got it all wrong . &quot;
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
That &apos;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .
Don &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot;
I &apos;m going to do what philosophers do .
He didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
And the same is true of consciousness .
Now , let &apos;s see if this will work . All right . Let &apos;s just watch this .
Watch it carefully .
We &apos;re looking for a backer .
That &apos;s the detail part .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
It &apos;s the same thing .
It &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
Yes .
Yes , it &apos;s possible to do that .
Can you see it ?
It &apos;s a Necker cube .
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .
This is change-blindness .
No trouble there .
Can you see that one ?
2.9 seconds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
It &apos;s easy .
Is it a bridge or a dock ?
Can you see it ?
Audience : Yes .
Right in the middle of the picture !
Thanks very much for your attention .
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
Thank you very much .
And the other is becoming paraplegic .
Why ?
And here are three guys synthesizing happiness .
Who are these characters who are so damn happy ?
He lost his money ; he lost his power .
What other way would there be to be better off ?
Here it is , finally to be revealed .
It &apos;s very simple .
Would you like to see it again ? Happiness !
I &apos;ll take number three . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to show you why .
&quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
You get to keep one , and I get to keep one . &quot;
Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic .
You will never see it again . &quot;
And look at what we find .
Is there really nothing good or bad ?
They can &apos;t be exactly the same .
Thank you .
So this is a brief overview .
This is our home ground .
Here is another school .
One billion people live in abject poverty .
So why not this many people ?
Secondly , what will this thing be ?
So doing that globally .
Thank you .
